Correio Braziliense - Pastor Ana Paula Valadão was ordered by the Brasília court to pay R$25,000 for collective moral damages for associating homosexuality with the development of AIDS. The decision was made by Judge Hilmar Castelo Branco Raposo Filho, of the 21st Civil Court of Brasília of the Court of Justice of the Federal District and Territories.
The case occurred in 2016 during a broadcast on the Super Television Network. "This (homosexuality) is not normal. God created man and woman and that's how we believe. Here's AIDS to show that sexual union between two men causes a disease that leads to death, contaminates women, in short... It's not God's ideal," said Ana Paula Valadão.
"Do you know what safe sex is? That doesn't transmit any disease? Safe sex is called the wedding ring," she added. HIV, which can lead to the development of AIDS if the patient does not receive treatment, can infect anyone who has unprotected sexual contact with a carrier of the virus, regardless of sexual orientation. Patients undergoing treatment for more than six months do not transmit the virus, even in unprotected sex, because they have an undetectable viral load.
In the lawsuit, Ana Paula Valadão claimed that she was exercising her "legitimate right to freedom of expression and religion". However, for the magistrate, the pastor made statements that are not supported either by the Bible or by science and attributed to the LGBTQIA+ population a responsibility that does not exist.
"The unjust and outdated blame for the emergence and spread of a terrible disease has been revived for an entire section of the population, a situation that undermines fundamental collective interests. The manifestation and dissemination of the wrong opinion attributes a non-existent responsibility to the LGBTI+ population, affecting the dignity of these people in a trans-individual way, precisely what characterizes the injury pointed out by the plaintiff," highlights an excerpt from the decision.
The TV station was also condemned for having provided its structure to broadcast the damaging statements. The decision can be appealed.

2024 APR 17 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Investigators publish new report on HIV/AIDS. According to news reporting out of the Universitas Kristen Krida Wacana by NewsRx editors, research stated, "This study explores the psychological responses and coping mechanisms employed by gay men in adapting to HIV/AIDS." 
 The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Universitas Kristen Krida Wacana: "This research is qualitative research with descriptive methods. The sample was taken using a purposive sampling technique with inclusion criteria, namely: gays who were declared positive for HIV/AIDS as proven by a doctor's statement stating that they were positive for COVID-19, were undergoing medical treatment both inpatient and outpatient, had experience interacting with nurses when undergoing treatment. This study involved four key informants to recruit potential participants who meet the inclusion criteria. Data analysis involved thematic analysis. 14 participants were included. Four themes emerged: (1) anxiety and stress arising from interpersonal conflicts post-diagnosis, (2) diverse stages of the grieving process, (3) feelings of helplessness confronting the reality of HIV/AIDS, and (4) utilization of problem-solving coping mechanisms as a means of acceptance." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "The study emphasizes the importance of empowering gay men with HIV/AIDS by facilitating access to healthcare and social support. Empowerment enhances their ability to leverage internal resources to manage the disease, ultimately aiding them in leading more fulfilling lives."

The International AIDS Society issued the following agency statement on April 3, 2024:
* * *
IAS - the International AIDS Society - is deeply concerned about the HIV response in Uganda following its Constitutional Court's ruling to uphold the Anti-Homosexuality Act today.
As the world's largest association of people living with, affected by and working on HIV, the IAS calls on Uganda to put people first and reverse this devastating law, which threatens its own citizens and prevents an effective HIV response.
"The court had the opportunity to set matters right, but it has failed to follow the science and heed evidence," IAS President Sharon Lewin said.
"The ruling is completely at odds with Uganda's stated commitment to ending HIV as a threat to public health by 2030. The consequences for the HIV response, not just in Uganda, but in other African countries grappling with anti-gay sentiment, are severe."
"Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni signed the Anti-Homosexuality Act into law in May 2023. One of the harshest anti-gay laws in the world, it imposes the death sentence for "aggravated homosexuality".
Responding to a petition to annul the act, the court found that some sections of the law violated the right to health and that the law was "inconsistent with right to health, privacy and freedom of religion". However, it declined to nullify the act "in its entirety" and neither would it grant a permanent injunction against its enforcement.
The IAS is concerned about the law keeping communities away from accessing HIV services and further marginalizing vulnerable populations. Anti-gay laws are associated with a higher HIV rate among men who have sex with men in Africa.
Since the Ugandan anti-gay law was passed, the number of clients attending drop-in centres providing HIV prevention and treatment services to key populations, including men who have sex with men, dropped from an average of 40 per week to two.
As the IAS has pointed out in a previous statement, the evidence is clear: criminalizing same-sex relations sharply increases the chances of acquiring HIV.

2024 APR 10 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Policy and Law Daily -- Current study results on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news originating from Tampa, Florida, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, "This queer narrative study examined the stories of two gay college men living with HIV and their relationship to HIV/AIDS. Foucault's technologies of the self served as the conceptual framework." 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Southern Florida, "Technologies of the self are practices, strategies, and narratives participants used to resist the stigmatizing symbolic violence of AIDS. The men practiced different yet interlocking technologies of the self. They took partial control of the meaning of HIV/AIDS in ways that improved their lives and helped them navigate college. However, homophobic AIDS signifiers resulted in them taking personal responsibility for HIV/AIDS rather than understanding it as a structural inequity, which limited them personally and academically. Higher education environments were a place of stigma and support, leaving the men unsure of how to navigate oppressive environments on campus." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Implications for reframing college student identity theory, addressing AIDS stigma on campus and beyond, and supporting students living with HIV are provided." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

2024 FEB 15 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Investigators discuss new findings in HIV/AIDS. According to news reporting originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Global HIV/AIDS responses have been increasingly biomedically dominated over the past years. In line with this shifting paradigm, China has prioritized mass HIV testing as a practical approach to controlling its HIV/AIDS epidemics among at-risk populations, especially gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM)." 
 The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Beihang University: "This study analyzed why China's mass HIV testing mainly targeted gay men by understanding the perspectives of public health professionals, community-based organization (CBO) workers, and gay men. In addition, this study revealed the tensions and unintended consequences of HIV/AIDS prevention and the representation of gay men in China. The study involved fieldwork conducted in a major city in Eastern China from 2015 to 2019. Semi-structured interviews were held with participants from the three abovementioned groups ( N = 25). The study identified four processes concerning why gay men are mainly targeted for HIV testing. Some public health professionals believe that being a gay man is equivalent to having HIV/AIDS risks. In addition, this study particularly noted tensions between public health professionals and gay men, including gay men-identified CBO workers, over whether mass HIV testing should target gay men or anyone who engaged in sexual risk behaviors." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "This study argued that a particular focus on gay men due to pursuing biomedical advances in HIV/AIDS prevention seems to have unintendedly stereotyped gay men based on the presumptions that they are at risk of developing HIV/AIDS. In addition, this study corresponded to the broader social scientific discussion concerning whether HIV/AIDS intervention should target specific sexual risk practices or sexual identity/population."

Oprah Honors Her Gay Brother Who Died From AIDS at the GLAAD Media Awards

At the 35th Annual GLAAD Media Awards - which honors outstanding achievements in LGBTQ+ representation in media - mogul Oprah Winfrey received the prestigious Vanguard Award for her decades of allyship with the community. Winfrey emotionally paid homage to her late brother Jeffrey Lee, who died of AIDS at age 29 in 1989.
"At the time, I really didn't know how deeply my brother internalized the shame that he felt about being gay," Winfrey said from the stage at the Beverly Hilton on March 14. "I wish he could have lived to witness these liberated times and to be here with me tonight."
Winfrey recalled visiting Williamson, West Virginia, in 1987, after the town shut down a public pool that a man with AIDS had swam in. The Oprah Winfrey Show attempted to examine and fight back at the bias and misinformation. The talk show later returned to Williamson in 2010, tracking the evolution - and in some cases, lack of evolution - in the mindset of community members over the decades.
Winfrey also played the pivotal role as Ellen DeGeneres' therapist in the iconic coming-out episode of Ellen - to which many fans did not take kindly.
"People were actually writing down and paying for a stamp and mailing in their hate and outrage," Winfrey recalled.
In the ensuing years, on her legendary talk show, the OWN network and Apple TV, Winfrey has lifted LGBTQ+ voices. In 2021, Elliot Page sat down with Winfrey to discuss his transition.
She also promised the GLAAD audience that she would continue to support the community and "the truth of a fellow human."
"That's what I wish my brother Jeffrey could have experienced ... a world that could see him for who he was and appreciate him for what he brought to this world," Winfrey said.
The Stephen F. Kolzak Award went to Niecy Nash-Betts, who appeared at the banquet with her wife Jessica. Nash-Betts encouraged the crowd to "continue to fight to normalize love."
Fellow Travelers, Yellowjackets, David Archuleta and Renee Rapp were in the winner's circle at the ceremony.
Fellow Travelers took home the award for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series. Producers Robbie Rogers and Ron Nyswaner told Los Angeles magazine that the environment on the set felt uniquely uplifting and accepting.
"It was special having our cast and producers and directors and a number of people [who are] part of the LGBTQ community," Rogers said.
"Our show has several LGBTQ characters played by several out LGBTQ actors, which is kind of groundbreaking in some ways," Nyswaner said. "And we are doing it to inspire and encourage and show our level of gratitude to our community."
Rapp won Outstanding Music Artist and Archuleta took home the honor for Outstanding Breakthrough Music Artist.
"It's easy to overlook how much the LGBTQ+ community has contributed to the arts and entertainment," Archuleta told Los Angeles. "Like they do a buttload ... they've contributed so much. So to be able to see everybody and recognize what they've done, the influence that they've had on culture ... is pretty fun to see and recognize."
Bottoms was named Outstanding Film - Wide Release, Yellowjackets won Outstanding Drama Series, Star Wars: Doctor Aphra was honored as Outstanding Comic Book and recognitions were given to Renaissance: A Film By Beyonce and documentary short The Dads, among other awards. The ceremony also cited achievements in journalism, along with other prominent media representations of LGBTQ+ people.
Stars on the red carpet ahead of the ceremony extolled the importance of GLAAD, which was celebrating its 35th annual awards ceremony. 
"[GLAAD] is absolutely magical," singer-songwriter Jojo Siwa said. "Everyone in this room you know is safe, loving and accepting."
"As performers, sometimes it just never feels like it's getting easier - it feels like you're always fighting a little bit of a battle," said Fire Island and Good Trouble star Zane Phillips. "It's nice to be surrounded by queer people to just look at how much joy there is, and how much talent there is in the room - to just celebrate each other and be able to forget everything else."
"I think it's more important now than ever to raise our voices and show support," said Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause, who attended with her spouse G Flip. "The trans community is being attacked. I think that the more voices we can get behind this movement, and the louder we can be, and [showing the] faces behind the support ... it kind of makes it not so scary to the people that don't know someone that is trans, or don't know someone who is queer or gay."
Stars who attended in support included Billie Joe Armstrong, Dylan Mulvaney, Hannah Waddingham, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Jason Sudeikis, Jonathan Bailey, Juno Temple, Liv Hewson, Matt Bomer, Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, Scott Evans, Sharon Stone, Shonda Rhimes, Sydney Sweeney, Trace Lysette and the casts of Ted Lasso, Yellowjackets and RuPaul's Drag Race.
On the carpet, nominees expressed gratitude for being included in GLAAD's prestigious canon of media.
"I'm proud ... to be a part of the show that really emphasizes bringing awareness and representation," Quantum Leap star Nanrisa Lee said.
"To understand sexism, to understand racism, to understand what it's like to be a normal person, but seen differently, is a unique opportunity," said Quantum Leap executive producer Deborah Pratt.
The 35th GLAAD Media Awards come at a time when LGBTQ+ representation is on the decline in mainstream media for the first time in years.
"We have to continue finding a way to tell queer and trans stories in mainstream media," said activist Ashley Marie Peterson, who is launching an organization to help LGBTQ+ get in the room and be a part of creative teams. "At the end of 2022, a report showed that we lost 29% of our representation. There were only 596 LGBTQ characters, and we lost 175 of them."
This kind of statistic is why Mean Girls actor Daniel Franzese said he believes GLAAD is so important.
"The GLAAD Media Awards is a spectacular and incredible event," Franzese said. "They are our watchdog. They're our parents. They look out for us. The reason that we have LGBTQ+ stories being told on television is because GLAAD highlights them and shows them and rewards them."

Highlight: Anti-LGBTQ+ laws lead to stigmatism and deny access to lifesaving drugs and services
Body


Anti-homosexuality laws stop people from accessing lifesaving health services and seriously impede progress on eliminating HIV, a senior UN official has said.
Sixty-seven countries have laws that criminalise gay sex, and nearly half  are in Africa, the continent most affected by HIV.  In those countries, prevalence rates are about five times higher  among gay men than in countries where same-sex relations are not criminalised, according to figures from UNAids.
“When LGBTQ+ people and other marginalised communities are stigmatised and criminalised, their access to lifesaving health services is obstructed, and the HIV response is undermined,” said Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of UNAids.
Earlier this year, Uganda passed one of the world’s harshest anti-LGBTQ+ laws , making gay sex punishable by life in prison, and “aggravated homosexuality” – which includes transmitting HIV – punishable by death. It also criminalises any person who fails to report same-sex acts to the police.
The law has already generated a surge in human rights violations  and reduced HIV prevention and treatment  services for LGBTQ+ people.
Lois Chingandu, the director of external relations at the charity Frontline AIDS, said: “It is important that countries do more when it comes to investing in HIV prevention methods, but also show stronger leadership in countering anti-rights narratives within their countries.” Well-funded and highly organised movements are promoting anti-gender and anti-LGBTQ+ views, she added.
Ahead of World Aids Day on 1 December, the UN said  a life is lost to the disease every minute. Last year, 1.3 million people were infected with HIV. About 9.2 million people living with the condition did not have access to treatment. Gay men, transgender people, sex workers and people who inject drugs are among the groups most affected.
Adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa are at high risk of infection, with 3,100 girls and women aged 15-24 contracting HIV every week – accounting for three-quarters (77%) of new infections among young people globally.
Byanyima said girls and young women are more vulnerable because of their risk of experiencing gender-based violence , but also because of a backlash against sex education in schools.
Of the 120 countries that reported having a national plan for condom programming, only 39 endorsed condom promotion in secondary schools and only 21 allowed distribution, said the report.
“When young people are denied access to sexual education, they are made much more vulnerable to HIV,” said Byanyima. “The global anti-rights wave doesn’t just threaten democracy and personal freedom, it threatens the health of everyone.”
However, Byanyima said at the launch of the report on Wednesday that there have been successes in the fight to end HIV and Aids. Although there is no cure or vaccine for the virus, 30 million people around the world are on treatment, which can stop it progressing to Aids. New infections have dropped by 60% from their peak in 1995; deaths have fallen by 70% since 2004.
Last year, five countries – Botswana, Eswatini, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zimbabwe – achieved global 2025 targets  of ensuring 95% of the people living with HIV know their status, 95% are on antiretroviral treatment, and 95% on treatment are virally suppressed.
On Thursday, the Population Council announced that a vaginal ring to help women reduce the risk of HIV infection has gained regulatory approval for use in 11 countries in Africa.
The ring is made of flexible silicone and slowly releases the antiretroviral drug dapivirine in the vagina over a month.
“Women bear the brunt of the HIV/Aids epidemic,” said Jim Sailer, the council’s interim co-president. “The virus is one of the biggest threats to the health and wellbeing of women … We cannot achieve the sustainable development goal of ending HIV by 2030 unless we curtail this epidemic in women. Women deserve multiple options to protect themselves against this lifelong disease.”

 Medical authorities yesterday rejected claims by the United Nations and US government that Uganda, through its newly enacted anti-homosexuality law, is somehow plotting to deny HIV/Aids care to gay people.
ICYMI: US targets Aids cash cut over anti-gay law
Dr Daniel Kyabayinze, the head of public health affairs at the Health Ministry, told Monitor that the ministry has been, and will continue, providing care to everyone without discrimination.
'Healthcare is for everyone regardless of who you are. We even look after those who are on death row. Our work is a calling; it is not about feeling and interest,' Dr Kyabayinze said.
'Americans are trying to frame it as if we are against certain groups. I don't know why they are attaching the Anti-homosexuality Act to the Ministry of Health. It has nothing to do with health,' he added.
Joining other professionals, Dr Kyabayinze disagreed with views contained in a joint statement by the Global Fund for HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis; the Joint United Nations Programme (UNAIDS) and the US President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR).
READ: Mwenda, MP Odoi and nine others ask court to block implementation of anti-gay law
The statement suggested, without providing any real proof, that HIV positive homosexuals and lesbians in Uganda are now afraid to come out and seek medical and other care.
'LGBTQI+ people in Uganda increasingly fear for their safety and security, and increasing numbers of people are being discouraged from seeking vital health services for fear of attack, punishment and further marginalisation,' the statement read.
They said cutting homosexuals out from interventions would affect the country's plans to end HIV/Aids as a public health threat. The statement did not say where suspected gay individuals are asked to identify themselves as such, and then denied HIV/Aids treatment in Uganda.
Reported HIV prevalence among men who sleep with men is around 13 percent, according to data provided by the Uganda Aids Commission (UAC).
Managers of the PEPFAR programme recently warned that the country risks losing the $400 million (Shs1.4 trillion) support to millions of people with living with HIV/Aids in Uganda.
There are clauses in the Act which prescribe life imprisonment for engaging in homosexuality and 20 years imprisonment for activities by a person or organisation that seek to 'encourage' and 'normalise' homosexuality.
Homosexuality and lack of integrity:Which is Uganda's major problem?
Clause 2 c of the Act states that a person promotes homosexuality where the person 'provides financial support, whether in kind or cash, to facilitate activities that encourage homosexuality or the observance or normalisation of an offence under this Act.'
However, Dr Stephen Watiti, a person living with HIV/Aids (PLHIV), and chairman of the National Forum of People Living with HIV/Aids Networks in Uganda (NAFOPHANU), said although there is public disgust against homosexuals, they still receive health care just like any other PLHIV.
'There is nobody who is going to stop anyone from getting care. You may not even tell that someone who has come to the hospital is from the LGBTQ+ group,' Dr Watiti said.
'I know some of them who have HIV. [But] the majority of those people are not even HIV positive. Many LGBTQ members also get their medicines from abroad. The majority of those who are speaking here don't even have HIV,' he said.
All the same, Dr Watiti observed that Uganda could be in trouble if gay lobbyists succeed in halting funding for HIV/Aids.
'There is a lot of international politics at play. If they stopped funding for even a week, you would see trouble,' Dr Watiti said. 'You would lose somebody you know, it might not be overnight, because over 90 percent of drugs we have in the country are from these people; [donors like
PEPFAR]. The US government is not gay but they have lobbyists who can make a lot of noise and make life hard for you [Ugandans with HIV/AIDS].'
However, Dr Nelson Musoba, the Director General UAC, was optimistic that donor nations will not withdraw HIV/Aids funding.
'The US has said that there will be no delay, they have clarified. We've engaged with both the US government and the Global Fund. They have indicated that funding would be available,' Dr Musoba revealed.
Anti-gay law:Uganda daring the West?
The UAC chief noted that; 'they are just taking precautions and saying for communities that may be discriminated, 'What steps do we want to put in place to ensure that they continue accessing treatment to ensure that they continue to access treatment?''

 Medical authorities yesterday rejected claims by the United Nations and US government that Uganda, through its newly enacted anti-homosexuality law, is somehow plotting to deny HIV/Aids care to gay people.
Dr Daniel Kyabayinze, the head of public health affairs at the Health Ministry, told Monitor that the ministry has been, and will continue, providing care to everyone without discrimination.
'Healthcare is for everyone regardless of who you are. We even look after those who are on death row. Our work is a calling; it is not about feeling and interest,' Dr Kyabayinze said.
'Americans are trying to frame it as if we are against certain groups. I don't know why they are attaching the Anti-homosexuality Act to the Ministry of Health. It has nothing to do with health,' he added.
Joining other professionals, Dr Kyabayinze disagreed with views contained in a joint statement by the Global Fund for HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis; the Joint United Nations Programme (UNAIDS) and the US President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR).
The statement suggested, without providing any real proof, that HIV positive homosexuals and lesbians in Uganda are now afraid to come out and seek medical and other care.
'LGBTQI+ people in Uganda increasingly fear for their safety and security, and increasing numbers of people are being discouraged from seeking vital health services for fear of attack, punishment and further marginalisation,' the statement read.
They said cutting homosexuals out from interventions would affect the country's plans to end HIV/Aids as a public health threat. The statement did not say where suspected gay individuals are asked to identify themselves as such, and then denied HIV/Aids treatment in Uganda.
Reported HIV prevalence among men who sleep with men is around 13 percent, according to data provided by the Uganda Aids Commission (UAC).
Managers of the PEPFAR programme recently warned that the country risks losing the $400 million (Shs1.4 trillion) support to millions of people with living with HIV/Aids in Uganda.
There are clauses in the Act which prescribe life imprisonment for engaging in homosexuality and 20 years imprisonment for activities by a person or organisation that seek to 'encourage' and 'normalise' homosexuality.
Homosexuality and lack of integrity:Which is Uganda's major problem?
Clause 2 c of the Act states that a person promotes homosexuality where the person 'provides financial support, whether in kind or cash, to facilitate activities that encourage homosexuality or the observance or normalisation of an offence under this Act.'
However, Dr Stephen Watiti, a person living with HIV/Aids (PLHIV), and chairman of the National Forum of People Living with HIV/Aids Networks in Uganda (NAFOPHANU), said although there is public disgust against homosexuals, they still receive health care just like any other PLHIV.
'There is nobody who is going to stop anyone from getting care. You may not even tell that someone who has come to the hospital is from the LGBTQ+ group,' Dr Watiti said.

Highlight: ​Northern Ireland's foremost gay campaign group has accepted a five-figure donation from a pharma corporation which has come under intense fire over a highly-profitable anti-AIDS drug.
Body


The Rainbow Project's most recent accounts show that in 2022 it took a £25,000 grant from Gilead, a multi-billion-dollar firm headquartered in California.
The controversy surrounding Gilead largely relates to accusations of profiteering around Truvada, a drug that can prevent the transmission of HIV – a disease which continues to have a vastly disproportionate effect on gay people, and about which the Rainbow Project has campaigned.
Although the 2021 Census found that 2.8% of the UK population were gay or bisexual, 36% of people diagnosed with HIV in England were gay or bisexual, as were 52% of those diagnosed in Scotland.
In the UK, generic versions of Truvada are available freely on the NHS.
But in the USA the company has come in for sharp criticism from politicians over the price of the drug, which effectively placed it off-limits to anyone without health insurance.
The Congressional Committee on Oversight and Reform investigated Gilead's behaviour in 2019, and was told that the drug had netted the company a total of $36bn.
This was in part because Gilead was charging US patients what committee chairman Elijah Cummings called an "astronomical" $70 per pill – roughly $2,000 per month – whereas elsewhere it was selling the drug for less than $7 per pill because "Gilead has generic competitors there, but not here".
Prominent progressive politicians went on to denounce the firm's "greed", as did gay AIDS activist Dr Aaron Lord.
To this day, the controversy around Truvada has yet to fully abate; just last year the US government tried to sue Gilead, claiming that it was owed about $1bn in unpaid royalties for helping to develop the drug.
Gilead often gives money to what are now termed “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, asexual, and more” causes worldwide, leading some people online to accuse the firm of "pinkwashing" (in other words, seeking to deflect criticism by portraying itself as close to the LGBTQQIA+ movement).
In response to the donation to the Rainbow Project, Michael Weinstein, president of the US-based non-profit the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, told the News Letter: "Gilead is the poster child for drug company greed... they always choose profit over people.
"Dropping a few crumbs off the table to help struggling non-profits is just a fig leaf to cover-up their irresponsibility."
The Rainbow Project has previously said that the authorities must strive to "end new HIV infections within a generation".
Repeated efforts have been made to elicit some comment from the Rainbow Project, and details of what Gilead's £25,000 was used for, but no response has been forthcoming.
Gilead told the News Letter: "Gilead has been in the fight against HIV for more than 35 years and has an unwavering commitment to helping end the HIV epidemic for everyone, everywhere.
"We’re proud of our work to help tackle the root causes of the HIV epidemic worldwide, and are in constant conversation with scientists, advocates, medical professionals and other individuals who share our commitment to better understand their needs and determine where support is needed.
"For every type of therapy we develop, our strategy includes just as much focus on health equity – how we will reach those who stand to benefit – as it does on scientific research, manufacturing and marketing.
"We believe impact is best achieved by working together with those on the ground and within the community and we are proud that Gilead has been recognized as the number one funder of HIV-related philanthropy globally in a report by the Funders Concerned About AIDS (FCAA), widely regarded as the most comprehensive study of its kind."

2023 JUN 12 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx COVID-19 Daily -- Current study results on HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news reporting out of the University of Victoria by NewsRx editors, research stated, "Pandemics are a component of human life, and have had great bearing on the trajectory of human evolution." 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Victoria: "Historically, the biomedical aspects of pandemics have been overrepresented, but there is growing recognition of the degree to which pandemics are socially and culturally embedded, highlighting how virus perception is socially and politically informed. Older (50+), gay men represent a population who have experienced two global pandemics in their lifespans: HIV/AIDS and COVID-19. Although governments and health officials largely failed gay men during the HIV/AIDS pandemic, gay men represent an important source of pandemic information and their experiences have much to offer health professionals and policymakers. As such, a small but growing body of literature has compared gay men's experiences amidst the two pandemics. The current study drew on constructivist grounded theory methods to examine how living through the HIV/AIDS pandemic has influenced older gay men's perspectives of COVID-19. Twenty Canadian-based gay men aged 50+ participated in semi-structured interviews via Zoom." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "Analysis revealed three key processes: (1) uncertainty and the familiarity of loss, (2) witnessing pandemic inequities, and, (3) navigating constantly evolving (mis)information. We highlight the utility of this knowledge to informing future pandemic planning and policies."

 Washington indefinitely defers Uganda Country Operational Plan 2023 final presentation meeting due tomorrow for determining PEPFAR's investment for next year, pending a decision on the Anti-Homosexuality Act.
The United States has put Uganda on notice that it risks losing $400 million (Shs1.4t) in Washington's annual support to HIV/Aids care and treatment over the Anti-Homosexuality Bill.
Parliament, by an overwhelming majority, enacted the legislation on March 21, setting out a plethora of tougher penalties including death sentence for the worst offences.
President Museveni has, however, returned the Bill to the House, asking lawmakers to criminalise only those practicing homosexuality, not those who just identify by the sexual orientation. He also asked them to drop the offence of failure to report homosexuals to authorities.
He proposed that homosexuals who stop the practice should not be penalised but rather rehabilitated.
With Parliament yet to consider the President's recommendations, which they under the Ugandan law are permitted to accept, reject or vary, the US government red-flagged that its support to 1.4 million Ugandans living with HIV/Aids is at stake over the legislation.
Majority of these individuals receive life-saving Anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs through $400m (Shs1.4t) annual kitty for Uganda under the US President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar).
Despite President Museveni withholding his signature on the current version of the legislation, and Parliament's reconsideration of the Bill pending, Pepfar in a signal of its intended action, announced indefinite deferral of the Uganda Country Operational Plan 2023 (COP23) final presentation meeting initially set for tomorrow.
The decision was taken, according to Dr John Nkengasong, the US Global Aids coordinator, 'in light of the potential signing of the Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA).'
The meeting was meant to conclude on Pepfar Uganda's investment priority for the next financial year.
Ms Ellen Masi, the public affairs officer at the US Embassy in Kampala, told this newspaper that they were unsure whether deferral of the April 28 meeting would affect flow of funds to buy medicines and support persons living with HIV (PLHIV).
'The delay in the meeting will give us time to review the [Bill] and it also depends on when the [Bill] is signed. That is unclear too. The condition is that we should review the [Bill] and determine how we can move forward,' she said.
Ms Masi added: 'Hopefully, [this legal concern will be addressed] quickly in time for the process to continue without any repercussion. We don't know [whether this wouldn't affect the flow or availability of funds] because we don't know when the [Bill] will be signed.'
President Museveni, in an address last week to the National Resistance Movement (NRM) Caucus, in apparent reference to potential funding cuts to health sector and HIV/Aids care, said he was prepared to sign a revised version of the anti-gay legislation, but the country should be prepared to 'sacrifice'.
Dr Nkengasong, in an a February 15 letter addressed to US Ambassador Natalie Brown, noted that in the COP23, Pepfar was to address 'gaps among pediatric populations, key populations and adolescent girls and young women.'
Legislators, egged on loudly by faith leaders, enacted the Anti-Homosexuality Bill with speed, despite a 2013 version being struck down by the Constitutional Court months later on grounds that it was passed without quorum.
Western donors threatened to freeze development assistance over the law, bringing a clash between cultures and contestations over sexual orientation as a right into sharp and divisive focus.
Citing Uganda's sovereignty to make its own laws and the need to protect mainly school children from being recruited as gays and lesbians, alongside safeguarding traditional values, 389 legislators passed the new Anti-Homosexuality Bill proposed by Bugiri Municipality MP Asuman Basalirwa by acclamation. They, like President Museveni and religious leaders, said dissenting donors can keep their cash.
As the politics played out in Kampala, the leadership of the Church of Uganda, a province of the global Anglican Communion, frayed by Church of England's authorisation of priests to bless same-sex couples, pushed forward with its plans to sever ties with the Canterbury.
Uganda's new anti-gay law introduces tough penalties, including death for aggravated homosexuality, as well as imprisonment of up to 20 years for acts of homosexuality, promoting homosexuality, and child grooming.
Reacting to the threat by Washington over the Bill, Dr Micheal Lulume Bayiga, the Buikwe South MP, said foreign donors are using money to control Ugandans.
'This country under President Museveni relegated the duty of looking after the population to international agencies in the guise of health diplomacy. [But] this can be the tool of imperialistic control where Ugandans [surrender] their own independence to those who are sustaining the fight against HIV/Aids by giving aid in medicine,' he said.
Dr Bayiga, who is a member of the opposition Democratic Party (DP), added: 'It can be a tool of control by losing your independence [because] 95 percent of interventions in HIV/Aids are sponsored by other countries.'
With the Pepfar money, Uganda has been on course to reduce HIV/Aids as a public health concern by 2030, a global target.
In his address to NRM Caucus, President Museveni noted that 'one of the things they're (donors) threatening is to kill our 1.2 million people who have been surviving on Pepfar funds to buy drugs for HIV/Aids, so that we don't buy the drugs for our people and they die'.
'This is a simple matter which we can fight but parasites can't fight. If you fear to sacrifice, you cannot fight. In order for you to fight, I want to first cure you of parasitism. Europe is lost and they also want us to be lost. Those who want an easy life will end up being prostitutes,' he said to applause from the ruling party members.
Following this meeting, and a follow-up interface with the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee members on Tuesday - both aimed to canvass and harmonise a common position on a legislation, the President previously warned had 'foreign policy implications' - Mr Museveni asked MPs to make the changes he suggested and he can 'sign it'.
Dr Stephen Watiti, a person living with HIV/Aids, and chairman of the National Forum of People Living with HIV/Aids Networks in Uganda (Nafophanu), said some of the provisions in the law clearly violate human rights. He said the country needs to be inclusive in access to healthcare.
READ: Anti-gay law: Will Uganda withstand global backlash?
Parliament passes stricter anti-gay law
Anti-gay law: Uganda daring the West?
The 12 offences, penalties in new anti-gay legislation
He added that the view of people in foreign countries regarding HIV is different from Uganda's, an issue Dr Watiti said should be looked into.
'When I first heard about HIV in the 1980s, it was called gay-related immuno-deficiency virus or syndrome. But the majority of people who have HIV here are not homosexuals to my knowledge, but some people [who] have sex with men have a higher risk of contracting HIV because of their parts,' he said.
He added: 'I don't necessarily agree with donors that they will blanket (sic) cut off funds but I also don't agree with us [Uganda] saying if you come to my place as a doctor and find me having lubricants, condoms or HIV infection preventive medicine, then I am encouraging them [the homosexuals] to do it.'
According to the Bill, anybody who encourages or promotes homosexuality commits an offence.
'I don't believe in sex outside marriage or sex which is not between a man and a woman. I believe in faithfulness and abstinence. But I don't enforce my beliefs on everybody. From a public health point of view, we need to help people when they come for help, but not to make it difficult to come out because this will make them pass the virus to others since some of them sleep with men and women,' Dr Watiti said.
'Uganda can sustain itself'
However, both Dr Bayiga, a medical doctor and Dr Charles Ayume, the chairperson of the parliamentary Health Committee, believe that in the event that donors withdraw financing, Uganda can sustain itself using own resources.
'Therefore, we need to package ourselves and find ways of sustaining ourselves, especially sustaining the HIV fight, which we can! That is why we have companies which get support from the government, such as Cipla Quality Chemicals Ltd. It can make HIV medicines and they are supplying other countries. We need to look into our capacity and we weigh,' Dr Bayiga said.
Dr Ayume, who is also a medical doctor, said with this threat from donors, the government should go back to the drawing board and ask itself how it can be frugal and mitigate wastage. He said the government last year gave Shs50 billion for buying ARVs.
'We would like to thank Pepfar and all the donors for the support they have given us over the year. The support from Pepfar can't be taken for granted, they have touched so many lives,' he said.
He added: 'At least every family in Uganda has been touched by Pepfar in one way or the other, directly or indirectly. It has given people more hope. People who thought the world had ended are now back on employment and they are supporting their families and contributing to national development.'
According to Ms Masi of the US mission in Kampala, Pepfar's support of 'HIV treatment in Uganda has been tremendous, with the number of people living with HIV enrolled on live-saving HIV treatment increasing from just over 26,000 people in 2004 to over 1.3 million people in 2023'.
In response to our email inquiries, she noted: 'We can also see this impact through the number of HIV infections and deaths prevented. Scale up of Pepfar-supported HIV treatment in Uganda has averted almost 500,000 estimated HIV infections, including over 230,000 infections among HIV-exposed infants, and averted nearly 600,0000 HIV-related deaths'.
According to the 2022 statistics from the Uganda Aids Commission (UAC), up to 1.4 million Ugandans live with the virus, with 54,000 new infections registered in 2021 alone.
The country registered17,000 Aids-related deaths in the same period, according to the official statistics.
The country, with support from donors, spends anywhere between Shs300,000 to Shs1.1 million on each PLHIV, according to the year 2020 report by United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
Dr Ayume said even before the issue of Anti-Homosexuality came up last month, fatigued donors were already warning Uganda of possible cuts in funding for the HIV/Aids fight.
'As a country, we are aware that donors have their own demands. Covid-19 hit a number of these countries and the global economic outlook has not been good, this was worsened by the Russia-Ukraine war,' he said.
He added: 'There have been these indications about reducing donor support. This new development [enactment of anti-gay legislation] may make the conversation stronger, but the discussion has been there.'
The Members of Parliament in the HIV/Aids committee, in their August 18 report, indicated that the country has lost vital donors like the governments of Ireland and Denmark. This contributed partly to a funding shortfall of $120 million (Shs457b) in the 2021/2022 financial year, higher than the $77m (Shs293b) shortfall in the previous financial year.

The United States has put Uganda on notice that it risks losing $400 million (Shs1.4t) in Washington's annual support to HIV/Aids care and treatment over the Anti-Homosexuality Bill.Parliament, by an overwhelming majority, enacted the legislation on March 21, setting out a plethora of tougher penalties including death sentence for the worst offences.President Museveni has, however, returned the Bill to the House, asking lawmakers to criminalise only those practicing homosexuality, not those who just identify by the sexual orientation. He also asked them to drop the offence of failure to report homosexuals to authorities.He proposed that homosexuals who stop the practice should not be penalised but rather rehabilitated.With Parliament yet to consider the President's recommendations, which they under the Ugandan law are permitted to accept, reject or vary, the US government red-flagged that its support to 1.4 million Ugandans living with HIV/Aids is at stake over the legislation.Majority of these individuals receive life-saving Anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs through $400m (Shs1.4t) annual kitty for Uganda under the US President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar).Despite President Museveni withholding his signature on the current version of the legislation, and Parliament's reconsideration of the Bill pending, Pepfar in a signal of its intended action, announced indefinite deferral of the Uganda Country Operational Plan 2023 (COP23) final presentation meeting initially set for tomorrow.The decision was taken, according to Dr John Nkengasong, the US Global Aids coordinator, "in light of the potential signing of the Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA)."The meeting was meant to conclude on Pepfar Uganda's investment priority for the next financial year.Ms Ellen Masi, the public affairs officer at the US Embassy in Kampala, told this newspaper that they were unsure whether deferral of the April 28 meeting would affect flow of funds to buy medicines and support persons living with HIV (PLHIV)."The delay in the meeting will give us time to review the [Bill] and it also depends on when the [Bill] is signed. 
That is unclear too. The condition is that we should review the [Bill] and determine how we can move forward," she said.Ms Masi added: "Hopefully, [this legal concern will be addressed] quickly in time for the process to continue without any repercussion. We don't know [whether this wouldn't affect the flow or availability of funds] because we don't know when the [Bill] will be signed."President Museveni, in an address last week to the National Resistance Movement (NRM) Caucus, in apparent reference to potential funding cuts to health sector and HIV/Aids care, said he was prepared to sign a revised version of the anti-gay legislation, but the country should be prepared to "sacrifice".Dr Nkengasong, in an a February 15 letter addressed to US Ambassador Natalie Brown, noted that in the COP23, Pepfar was to address "gaps among pediatric populations, key populations and adolescent girls and young women."Legislators, egged on loudly by faith leaders, enacted the Anti-Homosexuality Bill with speed, despite a 2013 version being struck down by the Constitutional Court months later on grounds that it was passed without quorum.Western donors threatened to freeze development assistance over the law, bringing a clash between cultures and contestations over sexual orientation as a right into sharp and divisive focus.Citing Uganda's sovereignty to make its own laws and the need to protect mainly school children from being recruited as gays and lesbians, alongside safeguarding traditional values, 389 legislators passed the new Anti-Homosexuality Bill proposed by Bugiri Municipality MP Asuman Basalirwa by acclamation. They, like President Museveni and religious leaders, said dissenting donors can keep their cash.As the politics played out in Kampala, the leadership of the Church of Uganda, a province of the global Anglican Communion, frayed by Church of England's authorisation of priests to bless same-sex couples, pushed forward with its plans to sever ties with the Canterbury.Uganda's new anti-gay law introduces tough penalties, including death for aggravated homosexuality, as well as imprisonment of up to 20 years for acts of homosexuality, promoting homosexuality, and child grooming.Reacting to the threat by Washington over the Bill, Dr Micheal Lulume Bayiga, the Buikwe South MP, said foreign donors are using money to control Ugandans."This country under President Museveni relegated the duty of looking after the population to international agencies in the guise of health diplomacy. [But] this can be the tool of imperialistic control where Ugandans [surrender] their own independence to those who are sustaining the fight against HIV/Aids by giving aid in medicine," he said.Dr Bayiga, who is a member of the opposition Democratic Party (DP), added: "It can be a tool of control by losing your independence [because] 95 percent of interventions in HIV/Aids are sponsored by other countries."With the Pepfar money, Uganda has been on course to reduce HIV/Aids as a public health concern by 2030, a global target.In his address to NRM Caucus, President Museveni noted that "one of the things they're (donors) threatening is to kill our 1.2 million people who have been surviving on Pepfar funds to buy drugs for HIV/Aids, so that we don't buy the drugs for our people and they die"."This is a simple matter which we can fight but parasites can't fight. If you fear to sacrifice, you cannot fight. In order for you to fight, I want to first cure you of parasitism. Europe is lost and they also want us to be lost. Those who want an easy life will end up being prostitutes," he said to applause from the ruling party members.Following this meeting, and a follow-up interface with the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee members on Tuesday – both aimed to canvass and harmonise a common position on a legislation, the President previously warned had "foreign policy implications" - Mr Museveni asked MPs to make the changes he suggested and he can "sign it".Dr Stephen Watiti, a person living with HIV/Aids, and chairman of the National Forum of People Living with HIV/Aids Networks in Uganda (Nafophanu), said some of the provisions in the law clearly violate human rights. He said the country needs to be inclusive in access to healthcare.READ: Anti-gay law: Will Uganda withstand global backlash?Parliament passes stricter anti-gay lawAnti-gay law: Uganda daring the West?The 12 offences, penalties in new anti-gay legislationHe added that the view of people in foreign countries regarding HIV is different from Uganda's, an issue Dr Watiti said should be looked into."When I first heard about HIV in the 1980s, it was called gay-related immuno-deficiency virus or syndrome. But the majority of people who have HIV here are not homosexuals to my knowledge, but some people [who] have sex with men have a higher risk of contracting HIV because of their parts," he said.He added: "I don't necessarily agree with donors that they will blanket (sic) cut off funds but I also don't agree with us [Uganda] saying if you come to my place as a doctor and find me having lubricants, condoms or HIV infection preventive medicine, then I am encouraging them [the homosexuals] to do it."According to the Bill, anybody who encourages or promotes homosexuality commits an offence."I don't believe in sex outside marriage or sex which is not between a man and a woman. I believe in faithfulness and abstinence. But I don't enforce my beliefs on everybody. From a public health point of view, we need to help people when they come for help, but not to make it difficult to come out because this will make them pass the virus to others since some of them sleep with men and women," Dr Watiti said.'Uganda can sustain itself'However, both Dr Bayiga, a medical doctor and Dr Charles Ayume, the chairperson of the parliamentary Health Committee, believe that in the event that donors withdraw financing, Uganda can sustain itself using own resources."Therefore, we need to package ourselves and find ways of sustaining ourselves, especially sustaining the HIV fight, which we can! That is why we have companies which get support from the government, such as Cipla Quality Chemicals Ltd. It can make HIV medicines and they are supplying other countries. We need to look into our capacity and we weigh," Dr Bayiga said.Dr Ayume, who is also a medical doctor, said with this threat from donors, the government should go back to the drawing board and ask itself how it can be frugal and mitigate wastage. He said the government last year gave Shs50 billion for buying ARVs."We would like to thank Pepfar and all the donors for the support they have given us over the year. The support from Pepfar can't be taken for granted, they have touched so many lives," he said.He added: "At least every family in Uganda has been touched by Pepfar in one way or the other, directly or indirectly. It has given people more hope. People who thought the world had ended are now back on employment and they are supporting their families and contributing to national development."According to Ms Masi of the US mission in Kampala, Pepfar's support of "HIV treatment in Uganda has been tremendous, with the number of people living with HIV enrolled on live-saving HIV treatment increasing from just over 26,000 people in 2004 to over 1.3 million people in 2023".In response to our email inquiries, she noted: "We can also see this impact through the number of HIV infections and deaths prevented. Scale up of Pepfar-supported HIV treatment in Uganda has averted almost 500,000 estimated HIV infections, including over 230,000 infections among HIV-exposed infants, and averted nearly 600,0000 HIV-related deaths".According to the 2022 statistics from the Uganda Aids Commission (UAC), up to 1.4 million Ugandans live with the virus, with 54,000 new infections registered in 2021 alone.The country registered17,000 Aids-related deaths in the same period, according to the official statistics.The country, with support from donors, spends anywhere between Shs300,000 to Shs1.1 million on each PLHIV, according to the year 2020 report by United States Agency for International Development (USAID).Dr Ayume said even before the issue of Anti-Homosexuality came up last month, fatigued donors were already warning Uganda of possible cuts in funding for the HIV/Aids fight."As a country, we are aware that donors have their own demands. Covid-19 hit a number of these countries and the global economic outlook has not been good, this was worsened by the Russia-Ukraine war," he said.He added: "There have been these indications about reducing donor support. This new development [enactment of anti-gay legislation] may make the conversation stronger, but the discussion has been there."The Members of Parliament in the HIV/Aids committee, in their August 18 report, indicated that the country has lost vital donors like the governments of Ireland and Denmark. This contributed partly to a funding shortfall of $120 million (Shs457b) in the 2021/2022 financial year, higher than the $77m (Shs293b) shortfall in the previous financial year.tabet@ug.nationmedia.com   2022 Nation Media Group Limited.

The following information was released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):
Dear Colleague:
Today is National Gay Men's HIV/AIDS Awareness Day (NGMHAAD), a day to help end HIV stigma and encourage HIV testing, prevention, and treatment among gay and bisexual men.
This year, we are highlighting the success of Together TakeMeHome (TTMH), a program with the goal of bringing HIV testing to people wherever they aredistributing at least 1 million free HIV self-tests by mail over the next five years. TTMH overcomes economic, geographic, and social barriers to HIV testing and has been proven to work in a randomized trial with gay and bisexual men.
Setting up a system where people can order HIV self-tests through the internet and apps has been shown to be highly effective, and cost-saving to the health care system. TTMH not only brings testing to people wherever they are, but many of the people who test report never having tested for HIV previously. We invite all of us working in HIV, including those in health care, and public health to continue promoting TTMH to populations in need. Regardless of the test results, anyone who would like additional support can reach out to the TTMH support via email or telephone. People who receive a negative test result can take advantage of HIV prevention tools such as PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) and condoms. People who receive a positive test result can start HIV treatment (antiretroviral therapy, or ART) to stay healthy. Learn more about innovative ways to increase access to HIV prevention and treatment.
This NGMHAAD, help us raise awareness about HIV testing, prevention, and treatment for gay and bisexual men by downloading and sharing resources from CDC's Let's Stop HIV Together campaign, the national campaign of the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) initiative and the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. Let's Stop HIV Together is an evidence-based campaign created in English and Spanish that aims to empower communities, partners, and health care providers to reduce HIV stigma and promote HIV testing, prevention, and treatment. You can also share social media content from CDC's digital toolkit using the #NGMHAAD and #StopHIVTogether hashtags.
Together, we can build on the progress made through TTMH, reduce HIV incidence, and continue working toward the end of the HIV epidemic in this country.

2024 MAY 07 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx COVID-19 Daily -- Current study results on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news reporting from Sydney, Australia, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, "Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) have developed community norms for regular HIV/STI testing. We investigated factors associated with self-reported COVID-19 testing in response to reported COVID-19 cases and public health restrictions." 
 Funders for this research include Department of Health & Ageing, New South Wales Ministry of Health, via the Prevention Research Support Program, New South Wales Ministry of Health, via the Blood Borne Virus, STIs and Viral Hepatitis Research Program (BRISE), National Health & Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia. 
 The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the University of New South Wales Sydney, "Participants responded to weekly cohort surveys between 10th May 2021 and 27th September 2021. We used the Andersen-Gill extensions to the Cox proportional hazards model for multivariable survival data to predict factors influencing COVID-19 testing. Mean age of the 942 study participants was 45.6 years (SD: 13.9). In multivariable analysis, GBM were more likely to report testing during periods of high COVID-19 caseload in their state of residence; if they were younger; university educated; close contact of someone with COVID-19; or reported coping with COVID-19 poorly. COVID-19 testing was higher among men who: were more socially engaged with other GBM; had a higher proportion of friends willing to vaccinate against COVID-19; and were willing to contact sexual partners for contact tracing." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "Social connection with other gay men was associated with COVID-19 testing, similar to what has been observed throughout the HIV epidemic, making community networks a potential focus for the promotion of COVID-19 safe practices." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

2024 APR 08 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Current study results on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news reporting originating in Munich, Germany, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, "The use of illicit drugs during sex (Chemsex) in gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men (GBMSM) has been a challenge for sexual health services globally. In Russia, HIV remains a significant public health concern and access to prevention and treatment services is limited." 
 Financial support for this research came from Terrence Higgins Trust. 
 The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Technical University Munich (TU Munich), "Little is known about the nature of Chemsex and the challenges GBMSM practicing Chemsex in Russia face when accessing medical care. This study explored GBMSM's experience with Chemsex and access to medical care. We conducted three focus groups with GBMSM (n = 19) based in Moscow and Yekaterinburg in December 2020. The focus groups explored their experience with Chemsex and accessing medical care. We used an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to analyze the data. GBMSM engaged in Chemsex through social networks and cited pleasure as one of their main reasons for engaging. The men described their addiction and perceiving many dangers at Chemsex group sessions. They reported using several self-care mechanisms to recover after a group session. Many reported feeling stigmatization from other members of the GBMSM community. Perceived barriers to medical care included legal barriers and stigmatization from medical professionals. To better support GBMSM, they felt there was a need for better access to sexual health and HIV prevention services, and psychological support. Our study highlights the unmet need in services for GBMSM engaging in Chemsex in Russia." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "It highlights how societal perceptions of homosexuality and drug use act as barriers to effective interventions for both sexual health and drug use." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

2024 JAN 23 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Current study results on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news originating from Toronto, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "While pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) prevents HIV acquisition among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM), PrEP-using GBM may be more likely to engage in sexual behaviours associated with bacterial STIs. We examined associations between PrEP use, condomless anal sex (CAS), number of anal sex partners, oral sex and bacterial STI diagnoses among GBM living in Canada's three largest cities." 
 Funders for this research include Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Canadian Association for HIV/AIDS Research (CANFAR), Ontario HIV Treatment Network (OHTN), Public Health Agency of Canada, Ryerson University, Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research, Canada Research Chair in Sexual and Gender Minority Health, Ontario Graduate Scholarship. 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Ryerson University, "Among HIV-negative/unknown-status GBM in the baseline of the Engage cohort study, we fit a structural equation model of the associations between any PrEP use, sexual behaviours and bacterial STI diagnosis. We estimated direct and indirect paths between PrEP use and STI via CAS, number of anal sex partners and oral sex. The sample included 2007 HIV-negative/unknown status GBM in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. There was a significant direct association between PrEP use and current STI diagnosis (beta=0.181; 95% CI: 0.112 to 0.247; p<0.001), CAS (beta=0.275; 95% CI: 0.189 to 0.361; p<0.001) and number of anal sex partners (beta=0.193; 95% CI: 0.161 to 0.225; p<0.001). In the mediated model, the direct association between PrEP use and STIs was non-significant. However, the indirect paths from PrEP to CAS to STIs (beta=0.064; 95% CI: 0.025 to 0.120; p=0.008), and from PrEP to greater number of anal sex partners to CAS to STIs were significant (beta=0.059; 95% CI: 0.024 to 0.108; p=0.007). Our study adds to the growing awareness that PrEP use among GBM may be associated with bacterial STIs because PrEP users have more anal sex partners and are more likely to engage in CAS." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "The results underscore the importance of providing effective STI counselling and regular testing to PrEP users, adapting PrEP care and related STI testing to individual needs, and the need for effective prevention strategies for bacterial STIs."

2024 JAN 25 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Current study results on Virology have been published. According to news reporting out of Tokyo, Japan, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, ">> Gesellschaftliche Vorstellungen von biografischem AIDS-Aktivismus unter schwulen Menschen mit HIV in Japan <<. The purpose of this paper is to examine the hidden history of AIDS activism among the sexual minority of those living with HIV (PLWH) who practiced societal envisioning from the 1990s to 2000s." 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Meiji University, "The concept of 'societal envisioning [shakai-koso ]' has been developed by sociologists in Japan. Based on research data from the life and oral histories of 22 PLWH, two biographies and related life documents were examined. One biography focused on the founder of a gaycontent magazine, the other on the editor of a medical information journal for PLWH. The former aimed to create a gay community through societal envisioning in cooperation with neighbors and visitors. The latter not only collected medical information but also used biographies to cultivate hope for survival and empowerment." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "By focusing on the concept of societal envisioning, this article contributes to Global Sociology as a way of exploring and discussing how people can confront and enable solidarity to change the lives of those who are colonized, oppressed, and marginalized by prejudice and discrimination." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

2024 MAR 06 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Health Policy and Law Daily -- Fresh data on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS are presented in a new report. According to news originating from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Black men face high rates of police violence, including direct victimization and indirect exposure to or knowledge of harmful policing. This violence can result in death and physical harm, as well as in numerous poor mental health outcomes." 
 Financial support for this research came from NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Medical College of Wisconsin, "There has been little research examining experiences of police violence experienced by Black gay and bisexual men or the effects of police brutality on HIV continuum of care outcomes. To address this important gap, in this exploratory study, we examined the effects of police brutality on engagement in HIV care and adherence to antiretroviral medications. Cross-sectional survey data were collected from 107 Black gay and bisexual men living with HIV. The path analysis showed that men with greater exposure to police violence had increased symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and were more likely to have missed HIV care appointments in the past year." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Additionally, there was a significant indirect effect of exposure to police violence on missed medication doses via PTSD symptoms." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

2024 MAR 27 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Investigators publish new report on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS. According to news originating from Montreal, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Gay, bisexual, and other men (GBM) who have sex with men living with HIV in serodifferent couples (one partner living with HIV, the other HIV-negative) may encounter unique sexual health challenges. This study aimed to explore their definition of sexual health that could improve service provision.Methods We interviewed 10 gay-identified men living with HIV from 2017 to 2019 as part of CTNPT013, a study on the sexual health of HIV serodifferent GBM couples conducted at two HIV-specialised clinics in Montreal, Canada." 
 Financial support for this research came from The Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre. 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from McGill University, "Participants partook in semi-structured interviews on the meaning of sexual health. We performed a content analysis of interview transcripts, coding them according to the 10 dimensions of Robinson's Sexual Health Model.Results Mean age of interviewees was 35.4 years (s.d.,10.2; range, 20-53). Every dimension of Robinson's model was spontaneously evoked, except for body image and spirituality. All men indicated intimacy/relationships (e.g. sexual agreements) and sexual health care/safer sex (e.g. HIV management, risk behaviours) as relevant aspects of sexual health. Other dimensions included: positive sexuality (n = 7), such as pleasure and enjoyment during sex; talking about sex (n = 5), which mainly concerned HIV disclosure; sexual functioning (n = 4); challenges to sexual health (n = 3), including substance abuse; and culture/sexual identity (n = 3). Two participants (n = 2) cited masturbation/fantasy.Conclusions This study emphasises the multi-faceted nature of sexual health for gay men with HIV in serodifferent couples and the pivotal roles of relationships, HIV, risk management (e.g. via health care, knowledge), and positive sexual experiences. These dimensions could be considered in sexual health promotion interventions targeting this population. Sexual health is a complex, multi-dimensional concept; however, much research on the topic is focused on sexually transmitted infections and risk reduction. Given their status as a key population for sexual health promotion, we interviewed 10 gay men living with HIV about the meaning of sexual health. While all mentioned sexual health care and safer sex (e.g." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "HIV management), most also addressed intimacy and relationships and well as positive sexuality as key components of sexual health."

2023 JUN 26 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Insurance Daily News -- A new study on HIV/AIDS is now available. According to news reporting originating from London, United Kingdom, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "The HIV/AIDS era has witnessed considerable discrimination against gay men and exposed the underlying issue of familization of health policies." 
 Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from London School of Economics and Political Science: "As the millieu constantly change over times, health policies catering the needs of family does not necessarily meet the needs of individuals. For instance, when viewing family as a unit, it held family members liable for certain duties, while easing the role of the state." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "It is important to recognize the needs of different population, mental health issues of sexual minorities as well as the intersectionality of inequalities that put certain group in an even more vulnerable stance. The essay illustartes the issue with health policies for gay men in the HIV/AIDS period and proposes recommendations for future policymakers by analysing peer reviewed papers on lessons learnt from the HIV/AIDS era."

LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Protesters gathered outside Los Angeles Councilwoman Eunisses Hernandez's field office in Glassell Park today and urged her to help preserve the residence of 20th century L.A. gay-rights pioneer Morris Kight.
The 1911 California bungalow home, located in the Westlake neighborhood, is listed on the California Register of Historical Resources. The protesters called for the site to be declared locally as a Historic Cultural Monument, but Hernandez's office has said she would support a lesser "site of" designation, which would allow the owner to redevelop the site.
"Our team is actively and really excited to be moving forward a process that designates the land as a cultural historical monument where we do pay tribute and homage to Mr. Kight, who spent decades creating spaces for community and advocating for the LGBTQ community," Hernandez told City News Service.
Hernandez said her office has had multiple conversations with stakeholders, including the property owner of Kight's home. She wants to move forward in the "collective interests of all," though she acknowledged there's a "spectrum of how people feel."
According to Hernandez's office, the home has changed throughout the years, and as it is now, the single-family home is not available to the public.
Hernandez said the First District, which she represents and where Kight's home is located, would better benefit from a community health center or affordable housing at the site that provides "access to the community" while uplifting Kight's legacy.
The "site of" designation would mark the parcel of land as a Historic Cultural Monument, whereas preservation advocates want the home itself to be protected as well.
"They (the city) just want to be able to put up a little plaque up," said Miki Jackson, a close friend of Kight's and an AIDS Healthcare Foundation consultant who led the protest Tuesday morning. "We have so few monuments, less than 1%, in this whole city that have to with the LGBTQ population."
The foundation is seeking a petition for Historic Cultural Monument status for the Kight residence, which will be heard Tuesday during the council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee.
"As Pride month begins, we call on civic-minded Angelenos and the public at-large to help save Morris Kight's home, site of some of the earliest uncloseted LGBTQ history in Los Angeles," Jackson said in a statement. "We urge city officials on the PLUM Committee to honor Morris' remarkable and fearless legacy by approving full Historic Cultural Monument status for his Fourth Street residence."
The Los Angeles Conservancy on its website states "Morris Kight (1919-2003) is considered one of the founding fathers of the American LGBTQ civil rights movement." His home was a "hub of LGBTQ social activity in the 20th century helped form the backdrop to his work as an activist and gay rights pioneer."
Kight co-founded several "prominent" LGBTQ rights organizations, including the Committee for Homosexual Freedom, which became the Gay Liberation Front in 1969, and spearheaded the formation of the Gay Community Services Center, better known today at the Los Angeles LGBT Center.
In 1970, he co-founded the Christopher Street West gay pride parade in L.A., the first gay pride parade and festival in the world.
Jackson said Tuesday's protest was "very successful" because the goal was to raise awareness and get the attention of the council.
"This is Pride month, and giving them (owner and developer) a license to tear down the very house where Pride was conceived -- our Pride parade on the West Coast -- is not the way to celebrate LGBTQ Pride Month," Jackson said.
"Especially, when we're threatened from all sides. There's over 400 pieces of legislation going through states all over this country to diminish, take away and criminalize LGBTQ+ people."
Jackson said the AIDS Healthcare Foundation will address council during Tuesday's meeting and continue to urge the PLUM Committee to give Kight's home the Historic Cultural Monument status to preserve LGBTQ+ history.

2024 MAY 07 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Current study results on HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news reporting out of Sao Paulo, Brazil, by NewsRx editors, research stated, "We investigated the experiences of Brazilian gay men with HIV, focusing on the moment of diagnosis and its potential biopsychosocial impacts." 
 The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Sao Paulo (USP): "This clinical-qualitative study involved 15 participants interviewed online and synchronously by a clinical psychologist in 2021. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the data. Interpretations were grounded in Minority Stress Theory. Four thematic axes emerged, including “Diagnostic Revelation”, “Social and Internalized Stigma”, “Biopsychosocial Effects of Living with HIV”, and “Gratitude for Treatment Advances and the Brazilian Health System”. The diagnosis was often experienced as traumatic, exacerbated by the absence of empathy and emotional support from healthcare providers. Participants commonly reported guilt, fear upon learning of their HIV status, social isolation, loneliness, lack of social support, and damage to affective-sexual relationships." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "Many also noted a decline in mental health, even those without HIV-related medical complications. Despite over 40 years since the HIV epidemic began, the prevalence of homophobia and serophobia among gay men remains widespread, including within the multidisciplinary teams of specialized services. This indicates that the stigma associated with homosexuality and HIV persists, despite significant biomedical progress in the diagnosis and treatment of the infection, particularly in Brazil."

Tajik police in the capital Dushanbe have detained ten gays on suspicion of spreading HIV/AIDS, Radio Liberty's Tajik service Radio Ozodi reported on 15 February.
"These ten homosexuals are men and are accused of infecting 86 people with HIV/AIDS," the report quoted the head of the Dushanbe police department, Barotali Hamidzoda, as telling a news conference the same day.
However, it noted that Hamidzoda had refrained from giving more details of the case.
For his part, Interior Minister Ramazon Rahimzoda told journalists that the number of cases in which homosexuals spread HIV/AIDS had "increased" in Tajikistan. "The people deliberately infected others with AIDS," he said as quoted by the website.
Radio Liberty said that the detainees' identities, their reaction to the detentions and whether they were provided with lawyers were "unknown". "Earlier, homosexuals complained that they were being persecuted and harassed by the police and residents. Some of them said that their complaints were not taken seriously by the police," the website went on to say.
The interior minister also denied that the police conducted special raids against homosexuals. "We are arresting homosexuals accused of spreading infectious diseases. Of course, the issue is under the control of international organisations. We are not carrying out raids. But when they commit crimes, they are always under control," Rahimzoda said.
According to the Radio Ozodi report, homosexuality is a "sensitive" issue in Muslim-majority Tajikistan. "Sexual minorities are considered 'vulnerable people' in the Muslim society of Tajikistan and, therefore, they are afraid to reveal their identity and only tell human rights organisations about their lives. The exact number of homosexuals in Tajikistan is unknown," the website said.
In 2017, the Tajik police registered over 300 representatives of sexual minorities in the country and said that they had been "included in the risk group", it recalled. "The list was compiled to ensure their safety," the police said at the time.

2024 MAR 19 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Psychology & Psychiatry Daily -- New research on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS is the subject of a report. According to news reporting from London, United Kingdom, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, "This qualitative sub-study aimed to explore how cisgender gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (cis-GBMSM) and transgender people who reported non-consensual sex (NCS) accessed health care services, what barriers they faced, and how this experience influenced subsequent HIV testing. SELPHI is an online randomized controlled trial evaluating both acceptability and efficiency of HIV-self testing among cis-GBMSM and transgender people." 
 The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University College London (UCL), "Semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed through a framework analysis, as a qualitative sub-study. We identified narratives of NCS from interviews and investigated experiences of cis-GBMSM and transgender people accessing health care services following sexual assault. Of 95 participants, 15 (16%) spontaneously reported NCS. Participants reported a broad range of NCS, including partner's coercive behaviours, non-consensual removal of condoms, and rapes. All feared HIV transmission, leading them to test for HIV, underlining a marked lack of awareness of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Most had negative experiences in communicating with reception staff in sexual health clinics following these incidents. A lack of confidentiality and empathy was described in these situations of psychological distress. Clinic visits were primarily focused on testing for HIV and sexually transmitted infection, and generally no specific psychological support was offered. Getting a negative HIV result was a key step in regaining control for people who experienced NCS. Sexual health care providers should take care to more fully address the issue of NCS with cis-GBMSM and transgender people when it arises." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "Recognizing and managing the emotional impact of NCS on affected patients would prevent negative experiences and increase confidence in care."

2024 MAR 19 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- New study results on HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news originating from Montreal, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "To cope with homonegativity-generated stress, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM) use more mental health services (MHS) compared with heterosexual men. Most previous research on MHS among GBM uses data from largely white HIV-negative samples. Using an intersectionality-based approach, we evaluated the concomitant impact of racialization and HIV stigma on MHS use among GBM, through the mediating role of perceived discrimination (PD)." 
 The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from McGill University: "We used baseline data from 2371 GBM enrolled in the Engage cohort study, collected between 2017 and 2019, in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, using respondent-driven sampling. The exposure was GBM groups: Group 1 (n = 1376): white HIV-negative; Group 2 (n = 327): white living with HIV; Group 3 (n = 577): racialized as non-white HIV-negative; Group 4 (n = 91): racialized as non-white living with HIV. The mediator was interpersonal PD scores measured using the Everyday Discrimination Scale (5-item version). The outcome was MHS use (yes/no) in the prior 6 months. We fit a three-way decomposition of causal mediation effects utilizing the imputation method for natural effect models. We obtained odds ratios (ORs) for pure direct effect (PDE, unmediated effect), pure indirect effect (PIE, mediated effect), mediated interaction effect (MIE, effect due to interaction between the exposure and mediator) and total effect (TE, overall effect). Analyses controlled for age, chronic mental health condition, Canadian citizenship, being cisgender and city of enrolment. Mean PD scores were highest for racialized HIV-negative GBM (10.3, SD: 5.0) and lowest for white HIV-negative GBM (8.4, SD: 3.9). MHS use was highest in white GBM living with HIV (GBMHIV) (40.4%) and lowest in racialized HIV-negative GBM (26.9%). Compared with white HIV-negative GBM, white GBMHIV had higher TE (OR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.27, 2.29) and PDE (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.27, 2.24), and racialized HIV-negative GBM had higher PIE (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.17). Effects for racialized GBMHIV did not significantly differ from those of white HIV-negative GBM. MIEs across all groups were comparable." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Higher MHS use was observed among white GBMHIV compared with white HIV-negative GBM. PD positively mediated MHS use only among racialized HIV-negative GBM. MHS may need to take into account the intersecting impact of homonegativity, racism and HIV stigma on the mental health of GBM."

2024 MAR 28 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Current study results on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news reporting from Chicago, Illinois, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, "Black men who have sex with men (MSM) have been consistently reported to have the highest estimated HIV incidence and prevalence among MSM. Despite broad theoretical understanding that discrimination is a major social and structural determinant that contributes to disparate HIV outcomes among Black MSM, relatively little extant research has empirically examined structural discrimination against sexual minorities as a predictor of HIV outcomes among this population." 
 Funders for this research include NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). 
 The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the University of Illinois, "The present study therefore examines whether variation in policies that explicitly discriminate against lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people and variation in policies that explicitly protect LGB people differentially predict metropolitan statistical-area-level variation in late HIV diagnoses among Black MSM over time, from 2008 to 2014. HIV surveillance data on late HIV diagnoses among Black MSM in each of the 95 largest metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, from 2008 to 2014, were used along with data on time-varying state-level policies pertaining to the rights of LGB people. Results from multilevel models found a negative relationship between protective/supportive laws and late HIV diagnoses among Black MSM, and a positive relationship between discriminative laws and late HIV diagnoses among Black MSM. These findings illuminate the potential epidemiological importance of policies pertaining to LGB populations as structural determinants of HIV outcomes among Black MSM." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "They suggest a need for scrutiny and elimination of discriminatory policies, where such policies are currently in place, and for advocacy for policies that explicitly protect the rights of LGB people where they do not currently exist." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

2024 MAR 27 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Data detailed on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS have been presented. According to news reporting originating from Kensington, Australia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Strategies pertaining to HIV and sexual health for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) have shifted focus towards underrepresented subgroups within some developed Western countries. Although emerging research exists on some subgroups, limited attention has been given to the needs of Arab GBMSM in these contexts." 
 Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the University of New South Wales Sydney, "Considering they are part of a large diaspora, understanding their access to services is crucial. This paper focuses on Arab GBMSM as a case study within a scoping review, highlighting their hidden status within the broader landscape of HIV and sexual health research for GBMSM in the West.Methods A multi-method search strategy was employed, including searching four electronic databases using several terms within each of the following search topics: Arab, GBMSM, HIV and other sexual health services, and developed Western countries.Results Of the 384 articles found, only one addressed the research question and met the inclusion criteria, revealing a stark scarcity of research on access to HIV and sexual health services for this population.Conclusions This review highlights a paucity of research on access to HIV and sexual health services for underrepresented GBMSM populations in developed Western countries. The literature indicates that, for Arab men, this may be due to a difficulty in participant recruitment and poor data collection efforts. By focusing on one hidden population, we aim to advocate for inclusive policies and interventions that promote equitable sexual health access for all. Addressing this research gap aligns with broader local and global HIV strategies to reduce disparities among underrepresented GBMSM populations. This study uncovers an often-overlooked issue: the limited research on access to sexual health services among gay Arab men in Western countries. Findings in this publication reveal significant gaps in knowledge for this population, particularly in areas where strides have been made in reducing HIV transmission. The implications are far-reaching, as addressing these disparities is essential for ensuring equitable healthcare for underrepresented communities." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "By shedding light on this hidden population, this study paves the way for targeted interventions and policy changes to promote inclusive and accessible sexual health services for all."

2024 MAR 06 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- New study results on HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news originating from Melbourne, Australia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "In Australia, the incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has declined among gay and bisexual men (GBM) with HIV since 2015 and is low among GBM using HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, ongoing HCV testing and treatment remains necessary to sustain this." 
 The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Burnet Institute: "To assess the potential utility of STIs to inform HCV testing among GBM with HIV and GBM using PrEP, we examined the association between bacterial sexually transmissible infection (STI) diagnoses and subsequent primary HCV infection. Data were from a national network of 46 clinics participating in the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance. GBM included had 1 HCV antibody negative test and 1 subsequent HCV antibody and/or RNA test. Discrete time survival analysis was used to estimate the association between a positive syphilis, rectal chlamydia, and rectal gonorrhoea diagnosis in the previous two years on a primary HCV diagnosis, defined as a positive HCV antibody or RNA test. Among 6,529 GBM with HIV, 92 (1.4%) had an incident HCV infection. A prior positive syphilis diagnosis was associated with an incident HCV diagnosis (aHR 1.99, 95%CI:1.11-3.58). Among 13,061 GBM prescribed PrEP, 48 (0.4%) had an incident HCV diagnosis. Prior rectal chlamydia (aHR 2.75, 95%CI:1.42-5.32) and rectal gonorrhoea (aHR 2.54, 95%CI:1.28-5.05) diagnoses were associated with incident HCV." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "Diagnoses of bacterial STIs in the past two years was associated with HCV incidence. These findings suggest that STIs might be of utility to inform HCV testing decisions and guidelines for GBM with HIV and GBM using PrEP."

US set to ease AIDS-era blood donation rules for gay men

American health authorities proposed a further easing on Friday of AIDS-era restrictions on blood donations by gay and bisexual men.
Under the current policy, gay and bisexual men, even those in monogamous relationships, must abstain from sex for three months to be eligible to donate blood.
The new proposed rules from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would do away with the 90-day requirement in favor of an individual risk assessment.
All blood donors are tested for HIV, but the virus may not always show up right away if someone is taking pre-exposure prophylaxis drugs.
At the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, the FDA imposed a lifetime ban on blood donations by gay men to prevent the spread of the HIV virus through blood products.
That was lifted in 2015, but gay and bisexual men were required to abstain from sexual relations for at least one year to be eligible to donate blood.
That period was reduced in April 2020 to the current three months because of blood shortages during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.
But it still prevented men in monogamous relationships from donating blood unless they abstained from sex for 90 days.
Under the new guidelines, all prospective blood donors would be asked in a questionnaire whether they had new or multiple sexual partners in the past three months.
Prospective blood donors will be eligible if they have not had anal sex with new or multiple sexual partners in the past three months. Those who have will be deferred for a donation.
The FDA said individuals who have tested positive for HIV or taken medication to treat an HIV infection would continue to be banned from donating blood.
- 'Important step forward' -
"Maintaining a safe and adequate supply of blood and blood products in the US is paramount for the FDA," FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement.
"This proposal for an individual risk assessment, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, will enable us to continue using the best science to do so," Califf said in a statement.
The FDA said the new guidance is in line with similar rules in place in Canada and Britain.
Representative Mark Pocan, chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, welcomed the revised FDA guidance.
"This is an important step forward towards ensuring our blood donation guidelines are grounded in science, not stigma against certain communities," Pocan said.
"I look forward to taking a closer look at the proposed guidelines once they are published and working with the FDA to ensure that any unnecessary barriers are removed."
The FDA guidance will be subject to public comment for 60 days after which it will be reviewed and finalized.

In the run-up to World Aids Day on December 1, The Argus looks back at the history of the HIV/Aids epidemic in Brighton, some 40 years after the virus was first detected in the city.
We spoke to Simon Fanshawe, comedian and one of the founders of the LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall, about his memories from the height of the epidemic and how people came together to support those living with the virus.
Some four decades later, Simon Fanshawe still remembers the exact moment he first heard about Aids. He was close friends with a scientist and he arrived at his house for dinner one evening in the early 80s.
He said: -My friend opened the door and he was ashen-faced. He said -I-ve just read this article in the New Statesman about this gay cancer-.
-At the time, it was called gay-related immune deficiency - Grid.
-He was absolutely shocked and I remember the rest of the evening was spent in a peculiar chill, not really knowing what to think.-
Simon, 65, didn-t want to believe the news at first.
He said: -I thought -come on, cancer can-t attack a sexual orientation-.
-It felt very much as if we were under siege. It was terrifying.-
At the time Aids reached Brighton, Simon, who lives in Kemp Town, had started to make a name for himself on the comedy scene, appearing at the Edinburgh Festival and on the Channel 4 comedy stand-up show The Entertainers.
Outside of his burgeoning career, Simon recalled how omnipresent the virus was.
-It was everywhere - every club you went to was collecting money, there was safe sex advice, there were leaflets everywhere," he said.
-You could not ignore it and most people I knew took it very seriously.-

He also drew a comparison to the recent Covid pandemic in the conversations people had around intimate relationships.
Simon said: -We used to sit around, in a similar way to Covid, trying to almost -risk assess- what we could and couldn-t do.
-'Is oral sex alright? Can we do that? What does the science say about that?' A lot of conversations were like that, it was bizarre.-
He was among those to get involved in the Sussex Aids Helpline, which provided advice for those worried about or affected by HIV and Aids.
Simon reflected on his memories of one of the founders of the helpline, Graham Wilkinson, who died of Aids in 1990.
He said: -Graham was marvellous - he was a really disagreeable person in so many ways, he was incredibly bad-tempered, but at the same time he was completely wonderful.
-He was amazing, he was one of the absolute leaders and fought for resources.-
Simon explained that there was an -extraordinary- response from activists, who helped fill the initial void in providing support for people living with HIV/Aids.
He said: -People went from flinging feather boas over policemen to this extraordinary response.
-Activists simply kitted themselves with the knowledge because no one gave a f***.
-They didn-t care if we were dying, so activists and doctors developed great expertise.-
In 1986, then-health minister Norman Fowler implemented a government-led drive to educate the public to the dangers of Aids.
Part of this effort was a campaign called Aids: Don-t Die of Ignorance, which saw television adverts and leaflets posted through every door in the country.
While critics have suggested the campaign has helped foster stigma against those living with HIV, Simon said that such an approach led to a wider conversation around the virus.
He said: -We used to joke about our granny getting a leaflet about getting Aids, but it made it easier to talk about and that was important.
-Notwithstanding all the prejudice and stigma, it nonetheless created a national conversation and infection rates in Britain were lower than they were elsewhere.
-Norman Fowler is an unsung hero in all of this - he had become a global expert on Aids and convinced the government and Margaret Thatcher that it was important to have that conversation.-
While Simon says he was somewhat fortunate in that few people he knew died of the virus, he said other friends of his -spent most of the 80s going to funerals-.
-It was so tragic - it was a f****ing death sentence, that was what was so awful in those days,- he said.

Looking to the present, Simon finds life today as a complete contrast, with people now able to live happy and fulfilling lives with HIV.
He warned against complacency, however, and encouraged people to be certain of their status.
-My view is that everyone should behave as if everyone is HIV positive, in the same way you would with any other infectious disease, and take precautions accordingly,- he said.

2024 FEB 01 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Data detailed on HIV/AIDS have been presented. According to news originating from the MacKay Memorial Hospital by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are associated with the widespread human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in Taiwan." 
 Funders for this research include Mackay Memorial Hospital. 
 Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from MacKay Memorial Hospital: "Additionally, little is known about disclosure patterns and rates, as well as factors influencing disclosure, among GBMSM living with HIV in the country. HIV prevention for GBMSM is effective when HIV status is disclosed. For instance, GBMSM disclosing their HIV status can result in early pre-exposure prophylaxis with a serodiscordant partner. In this cross-sectional study of 200 GBMSM living with HIV conducted from June to November 2020, we assessed internalized homophobia (IHP Scale) and social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support), as well as self-reported disclosure and non-disclosure. Among the participants, 75.5% revealed their HIV status within 3 months of diagnosis. Younger age, occupation type, and number of sexual partners were some factors associated with disclosure." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Those receiving more social support and who experienced less IHP were more likely to reveal their HIV status. On the contrary, older GBMSM and GBMSM living with HIV who worked in educational enterprises still experienced severe IHP. Policymakers and healthcare practitioners should be aware of the problems faced by GBMSM living with HIV and offer practical assistance to improve their mental health."

2023 DEC 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Data detailed on HIV/AIDS have been presented. According to news reporting out of Queen Mary University of London by NewsRx editors, research stated, "Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) experience a high prevalence of psychosocial health problems, such as harmful substance use and depression, as well as being disproportionately affected by HIV." 
 Funders for this research include Public Health England NIHR Clinical Research Network, United Kingdom Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, United Kingdom Gilead Sciences Medical Research Council. 
 Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Queen Mary University of London: "HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) may provide psychosocial benefits beyond its intended purpose of reducing HIV infection. We explore the psychosocial impact of oral PrEP use on gay men in England using qualitative data from the PROUD study. From February 2014 to January 2016, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 40 gay men and one trans woman. Participants were purposively recruited based on trial arm allocation, adherence, and sexual risk behaviours. By removing HIV risk from sex, PrEP improves users' wellbeing by reducing HIV-related anxiety and internalised stigma and increasing HIV prevention self-efficacy, sexual pleasure, and intimacy. In turn, these psychological changes may influence behaviour in the form of greater sexual freedom, reduced harmful drug use, and more protective sexual health behaviours." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "However, PrEP may create internal conflict for some gay men, due to its disruption of social norms around condom use and its perceived influence on their sexual behaviour leading to reduced condom self-efficacy. These findings provide a baseline of PrEP's psychosocial impact amongst some of the first PrEP users in England and supports calls to consider the psychosocial impact of PrEP in prescribing guidelines."

I hope my story will inspire others to embrace who they are and fight for what they believe in. It is important to promote inclusion and diversity in all aspects of society, and to continue working towards ending the AIDS epidemic. Dr. Bob's legacy and the many others who lost their lives to the disease will not be forgotten.'

CNN NewsNight host Abby Phillip tried without success on Tuesday to get Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz to agree with Sen. Bernie Sanders that the time has come to cut aid to Israel. Later in the show she also failed to get Manhattan Institute podcaster Coleman Hughes to agree that now former Harvard President Claudine Gay is a victim of racism or, at the very least, partisan politics.
Phillip wondered what so radical about Sanders's stance, 'I mean, conditioning U.S. aid to other countries is not a new concept. I mean, are you arguing that this is a military aid to Israel no matter what it does in any particular conflict?'
Moskowitz responded by declaring that anybody who actually supports a two-state solution should want to see Hamas defeated and wondered 'what kind of message do you think Iran is picking up right now watching Bernie Sanders talking about conditioning aid to Israel?'
After he claimed that all the misery in Gaza is the fault of Hamas, Phillip interrupted, 'Hamas is certainly responsible for the attack on October 7th. I think one of the things that Senator Sanders is pointing to, and he mentions this in his statement, he also mentions Netanyahu, but he talks about how the war is being carried out. It's not necessarily about Netanyahu specifically.'
She further wondered, 'CNN and other outlets have reported about the IDF's use of 2,000-pound bombs that produce really extraordinary death tolls, the fact that so much of Gaza is uninhabitable right now. People are basically starving to death, according to international agencies. What is the United States supposed to do to reduce those kinds of outcomes other than using the main tool that it has, which is military aid?'
After Moskowitz declared the quickest way for the war to end is for Hamas to surrender, Phillip tried another tactic, 'There are some in Netanyahu's government, including the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir  who tweeted that the Palestinians should leave Gaza and some in your party have called that a call for ethnic cleansing. I mean, these are some of the kinds of things that people are seeing and saying is there another motive here.'
Moskowitz condemned the 'despicable' comments, but noted that Israel currently has a unity government and every party, including his own, has people who say 'things that wildly crazy.'  
A few minutes later, Phillip seemed surprised that anyone could believe that Gay didn't resign because of racism or partisan politics, asking Hughes 'So, you don't think there was anything about this that had to do with the fact that she was a black woman from the people who were claiming this as a victory against DEI, diversity, equity and inclusion?'
Hughes stood firm, 'I don't think it did. And you know what, even if it did, that doesn't justify it. If you or I did this, or even any white scholar, it would be career-ending to have 50 examples of plagiarism. And it has to be because how can you be the one upholding Harvard's integrity when you yourself have failed? It's as if the commissioner of the Major League Baseball or the NBA had a lifelong history of steroid use and was now the person in charge of kicking other people out for steroid use. It's completely untenable.'
Phillip then turned to former Harvard Law School Student Body Co-President Mussab Ali who agreed with her, noting that the Harvard Corporation's investigation of the plagiarism allegations that basically cleared her of wrongdoing.
Turning back to Hughes, Phillip wondered about that, suggesting that conservatives focused on the plagiarism as a fallback because the blowback from her Congressional testimony was insufficient to get her to lose her job, 'I mean, why do you think? And, obviously, I should say, I mean, there was obviously the anti-Semitism issue, her testimony before Congress, which put her in the hot water to begin with, but after Harvard moved past that internally, this was the thing.'
Hughes, again, wasn't buying it, 'Yes, this was the thing. And, well, my question about the internal Harvard review that you seem to think was a very rigorous process is how did they only find, what, four or five examples of it when they were 50, almost 50 to find?'
It is a good question, maybe a journalist at CNN could ask someone at Harvard that very question.
Here is a transcript for the January 2 show :
CNN NewsNight with Abby Phillip
1/2/2024
10:10 PM ET
ABBY PHILLIP: I mean, conditioning U.S. aid to other countries is not a new concept. I mean, are you arguing that this is a military aid to Israel no matter what it does in any particular conflict?
JARED MOSKOWITZ: Well, look, I have faith in President Biden who has put immense pressure, and Secretary Blinken who will be going back to the region, who will continue to guide the Israelis on, quite frankly, what the next steps are. Because I think that is very important. I think we have to bring the Arab world and the Abraham Accord nations to figure out, you know, how we can rebuild Gaza and get back to talking about the two-state solution.
But if we start conditioning the aid, military aid that Israel needs to finish the mission against Hamas, who started this war when they ended the original ceasefire, who still has hostages, that is going to send the wrong message. I mean, what kind of message do you think Iran is picking up right now watching Bernie Sanders talking about conditioning aid to Israel?
So, this is a very dangerous conversation. And I think it will have repercussions beyond, you know, the current day-to-day situation in Gaza, which is absolutely horrific. No one wants innocent Palestinians to be dying. But remember, Hamas is the one responsible, not Netanyahu.
PHILLIP: But to that-- Hamas is certainly responsible for the attack on October 7th. I think one of the things that Senator Sanders is pointing to, and he mentions this in his statement, he also mentions Netanyahu, but he talks about how the war is being carried out. It's not necessarily about Netanyahu specifically.
CNN and other outlets have reported about the IDF's use of 2,000-pound bombs that produce really extraordinary death tolls, the fact that so much of Gaza is uninhabitable right now. People are basically starving to death, according to international agencies.
What is the United States supposed to do to reduce those kinds of outcomes other than using the main tool that it has, which is military aid?
MOSKOWITZ: Yeah, I mean, Abby, it's absolutely horrific. And what we need to happen is we need the war to end as fast as possible. We need the hostages to be released. We need Hamas to surrender. The war is over if that happens. And Israel needs to get out of Gaza, quite frankly. That's the quickest way for this to happen, is for the hostages to be released and for Hamas to surrender. No one wants this war -- go ahead.
PHILLIP: There are some in Netanyahu's government, including the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir who tweeted that the Palestinians should leave Gaza and some in your party have called that a call for ethnic cleansing. I mean, these are some of the kinds of things that people are seeing and saying is there another motive here.
MOSKOWITZ: Well, look, those comments are despicable, okay? They have no place in this conversation. But, you know, look, in a party, in a large party, you have people that say crazy things from time to time, or those are people in my party.
PHILLIP: He's part of Netanyahu's government. He's part of the government.
MOSKOWITZ: No, listen, but they have a unity government right now, which means all of the parties right now are part of the government. And so, look, I have people that I serve in Congress with. They're part of the government that are in my own party that say things that are wildly crazy, I think, sometimes. And then there're folks across the aisle, which every day reach a new low.
And so those comments are despicable. We got to make sure that we rebuild Gaza. We have to make sure that we have a two-state solution. And we have to finally use this unfortunate incident to try to bring stability to the world and piggyback off of the Abraham Accords and continue to expand that by bringing Saudi Arabia in.
But we have to make sure, we have to make sure that when this is over, that this doesn't become a worse situation. Israel has to recognize that they are not getting any of Gaza. Gaza is going to be part of a Palestinian state and the sooner that happens, the better.
PHILLIP: Congressman Jared Moskowitz, thank you very much for joining us tonight.
MOSKOWITZ: Thank you.
10:21 PM ET
PHILLIP: So, you don't think there was anything about this that had to do with the fact that she was a black woman—
COLEMAN HUGHES: No.
PHILLIP: -- from the people who were claiming this as a victory against DEI, diversity, equity and inclusion?
HUGHES: I don't think it did. And you know what, even if it did, that doesn't justify it. If you or I did this, or even any white scholar, it would be career-ending to have 50 examples of plagiarism. And it has to be because how can you be the one upholding Harvard's integrity when you yourself have failed? It's as if the commissioner of the Major League Baseball or the NBA had a lifelong history of steroid use and was now the person in charge of kicking other people out for steroid use. It's completely untenable.
PHILLIP: What's your view on whether or not this idea that the race of the person accused is not important here?
MUSSAB ALI: So, I think it's definitely a point here that really we have to look at. Because, you know, the example you gave for the president of Stanford, you know, when he came on, he had seven months of an investigation. There was an internal investigation. Kirkland Ellis was hired to actually go through and do a thorough view of the analysis of all of his academic work to go back and find that there was very serious allegations of plagiarism.
Harvard Corporation did an investigation. They could have done internal investigations. It took several months. Why is it that it took seven weeks to decide that this was too much, whereas the president of Stanford got seven months for similar allegations?
HUGHES: Well, look -
PHILLIP: I mean, why do you think? And, obviously, I should say, I mean, there was obviously the anti-Semitism issue, her testimony before Congress, which put her in the hot water to begin with, but after Harvard moved past that internally, this was the thing.
HUGHES: Yes, this was the thing. And, well, my question about the internal Harvard review that you seem to think was a very rigorous process is how did they only find, what, four or five examples of it when they were 50, almost 50 to find?
And plagiarism it's not like a, it's not like true crime where there's a million perspectives on it. You kind of either lifted the paragraph or you didn't.

• It's a Sin actor Nathaniel J Hall investigated the world of 'bug chasing'
• Read More: 19-YEAR-OLD who was diagnosed with HIV reveals what it's like
A controversial sexual fetish where people actively seek to contract HIV has been explored in a Channel 4 documentary.
It's a Sin actor Nathaniel J Hall, from Manchester, investigated the world of 'bug chasing' and spoke to a 'chaser', a man who doesn't take PrEP - medication which prevents HIV from getting into the body - in his mission to contract the virus.
Elsewhere Nathaniel met another man, a so-called 'gifter' with HIV, who is happy to transmit the virus to willing recipients.
Nathan, who is HIV positive himself, became emotional at one point, asking: 'Why do we feel so s*** about ourselves that we want to do this to ourselves.' 
One gay man explained it that it was always on his mind tht he could contract the virus, so his way of dealing with it was to 'actively chase it', while others seem to love the thrill of the 'risk' of catching the virus through unprotected sex. 
Although the outlook for people with HIV has significantly improved over the past 10 years, the virus damages the immune system, making it hard for the body to fight other diseases, which means it still has the potential to cause serious illness. 
Despite this, 'the chaser' admitted to going on the dark web to actively seek out people with HIV to send him their semen in a condom. 
He said: 'I went onto the dark web website, and they supposedly send you their semen in a condom. I tried it once and it hadn't worked.'
'The chaser' also revealed he wouldn't consider taking PrEP before sex with men whose viral load is detectable.
Viral load refers to the amount of virus in an infected person's blood. If a person is taking HIV treatment but their viral load is detectable, the treatment is not working properly and there may still be a risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners.
Asked why he doesn't take PrEP and carry on with the fantasy of having sex with HIV positive men, he said: 'If you're going to do what you feel is right, then it should be real, so PrEP is not on the agenda.'
'The chaser' revealed he would never take HIV medication if he did end up getting the virus, despite knowing he could die. 
He said: 'I don't feel the need to, I would just be my normal self until I can't carry on. I am prepared and ready for my time when it comes.'
Nathaniel pointed out that living with HIV costs the NHS, however the 'chaser' wasn't phased saying: 'I paid into the NHS my whole life. If I need to be cared for by the NHS then I expect to be.'
The 'chaser' detailed the first time he slept with someone with HIV, saying: 'I went to Amsterdam and went down the stairs and there was loads of hot guys, I gave one my phone number and three days later he messaged saying ''I got AIDS, haha'. I quite liked that.'
When Nathaniel asked if he was scared of getting HIV, 'the chaser' replied: 'No it's just like getting the flu.'
Nathaniel responded: 'Well, it is a little bit different to the flu, it can actually kill you.' To which 'the chaser' quipped: 'It can, but so can the flu.' 
The actor pointed out that without treatment AIDS is 'guaranteed to kill you' but the chances of dying from the flu 'are much less.'
'The chaser' added: 'Well on that point you are correct but I am 53-years-old, I have come to the point in life where I do what I want to do.'
Elsewhere Nathaniel met with a 'gifter' to find out the reasoning behind wanting to pass on the virus to others. 
Nathaniel, who was diagnosed with HIV when he was 16 and became an activist after years of shame, first heard about bug chasing 10 years ago when someone messaged him on a dating app asking would he 'gift them' his HIV. 
The actor said: 'I can't wrap my head around this. Why would someone want to pass on HIV? Most people who are HIV positive like me are taking medication so we can't pass it on and we are desperate not to, so this is the bit that I have been absolutely dreading.'
The 'gifter', who covered his face with a mask to conceal his identity, revealed he has been HIV positive for 18 months and he doesn't take any medication for it. 
He said: 'I have been doing unprotected bareback sex for about seven or eight years. It was always on my mind if this would be the time that I would end up HIV positive, I couldn't fully relax so in the end I decided to actively chase it.
'When I started doing bareback sex it was like being let off the leash almost, because I had led quite a closeted life until that point.'
                     THE DRUGS THAT SUPPRESS HIV AND PROTECT HIV-NEGATIVE PEOPLE FROM GETTING IT                   
 If left untreated, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which reduces the body's ability to defend itself against illness and infection.
The condition has been responsible for tens of millions of deaths since it was first identified in the early 1980s.
It can be spread through infected blood, semen, or vaginal fluids. Currently, there is no cure for the disease, however there are medications that can help those with HIV control and prevent the progression. 
Some people with HIV develop flu-like symptoms two to four weeks after getting the virus.
Symptoms of HIV include fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes.
HIV is estimated to affect around 100,000 people in the UK. 
1. Drugs for HIV-positive people 
It suppresses their viral load so the virus is untransmittable
In 1996, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) was discovered. 
The drug, a triple combination, turned HIV from a fatal diagnosis to a manageable chronic condition. 
It suppresses the virus, preventing it from developing into AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), which makes the body unable to withstand infections.
After six months of religiously taking the daily pill, it suppresses the virus to such an extent that it's undetectable. 
And once a person's viral load is undetectable, they cannot transmit HIV to anyone else, according to scores of studies including a decade-long study by the National Institutes of Health. 
Public health bodies around the world now acknowledge that U=U (undetectable equals untransmittable).
2. Drugs for HIV-negative people 
It is 99% effective at preventing HIV
PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) became available in 2012. 
This pill works like 'the pill' - it is taken daily and is 99 percent effective at preventing HIV infection (more effective than the contraceptive pill is at preventing pregnancy). 
It consists of two medicines (tenofovir dosproxil fumarate and emtricitabine). Those medicines can mount an immediate attack on any trace of HIV that enters the person's bloodstream, before it is able to spread throughout the body.
Speaking about 'gifting' his HIV to someone for the first time he added: 'I feel like I gave him a present he had been wanting for a long time.' 
He added: 'When people ask me to infect them, I do have quite a long chat with them about potential consequences.'
Nathaniel discovered that although most of the bug chasing is taking part online as a fantasy, there are a small minority of people who are acting it out in real life. 
He said: 'It's complicated but I think it has something to do with our shared experiences of stigma and shame as gay men.' 
Looking on an online forum, he discovered posts from people who talked about the efforts they've made - using the slag term 'poz' to indicate HIV positive. 
'I've crashed a few poz only parties. At one I had to pretend to be poz to get in, which by itself was such a rush,' one wrote. 
'You can see there's risk involved here. The thrill,' Nathaniel commented.

2024 FEB 13 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily China News -- New research on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS is the subject of a report. According to news reporting originating from Guangdong, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Chinese gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) face discrimination in many facility-based health services, thus increasing the importance of online engagement. The purpose of this study was to examine online GBMSM community spaces and implications for HIV/sexually transmitted disease prevention services." 
 Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the University of North Carolina, "We conducted a total of 6 online focus group discussions with Chinese GBMSM from Guangdong province on the chat-based platform WeChat in 2021. Focus group discussions were asynchronous, and participants were able to provide and map out online spaces that they had participated in and share their perspectives on online engagement. Data were analyzed through framework analysis. Overall, 48 participants participated. Most were mainly sexually attracted to men (n = 43; 90.0%) and never participated in in-person LGBTQ-related events (n = 29; 60.4%). Participants articulated a typology of online spaces along the axes of whether such spaces were Chinese platforms (vs. non-Chinese) or whether they were GBMSM-specific (vs. non-GBMSM-specific). Participants articulated several advantages of online spaces, including greater anonymity, opportunities for community building, sharing of sexual health information, and being able to meet other GBMSM more efficiently. Drawbacks included the lack of personal connection, lack of safety measures for youth, encountering deception and the use of fake profile pictures, and needing a virtual proxy network to access some websites. Participants provided suggestions to further improve their experiences of online spaces." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Although broad-based, GBMSM-specific messaging can be implemented in Chinese, GBMSM-specific spaces, sexual health messaging may also reach niche GBMSM communities in a variety of non-GBMSM spaces." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

In a decision that has sent shockwaves through pro-gay advocacy groups, the European Union (EU) has announced its intent to maintain its funding to Uganda, despite the enactment of the contentious Anti-Homosexuality Act.In a written statement released on Wednesday to the European Parliament, Ms Jutta Urpilainen, the European Commissioner for International Partnerships, expressed that halting financial assistance to Uganda due to the law that imposes punitive sentences for specific same-sex activities would result in withholding crucial support from vulnerable communities."At this moment, the EU considers that a suspension of EU financial support to Uganda would deprive the most vulnerable populations, including LGBTQI persons, from vital support. Disengagement by the EU would also create gaps which may be further filled by other players who do not share EU values," the statement reads in part.Ms Urpilainen adds: "Therefore, the EU will continue to use all opportunities of engagement with the Ugandan authorities and civil society, including in the context of its development cooperation and broader partnership, to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity, are treated equally".RespiteMs Urpilainen explained that top EU authorities had already expressed deep concerns with the promulgation of the law, and that they have raised the issue with the "Ugandan government, Parliament and President".The EU position, which was confirmed by representatives in Kampala, will come as a relief to the Ugandan authorities. 
Uganda's Western allies have been critical of the government since the enactment of the law.United States President Joe Biden branded the law as a tragic violation of universal human rights as his officials led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken threatened sanctions, including visa restrictions on Ugandan officials.The US has since imposed visa restrictions on some officials. The toughest response has come from the World Bank, which last month announced that it would be freezing all new public financing to Uganda.President Museveni has led other government officials in open defiance to the threats by the country's Western allies. In response to the World Bank, for example, the incumbent said Uganda will cut down on its borrowing appetite but would never give in to pressure.The EU decision also came hours after the National Unity Platform (NUP) party leader Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, called upon the EU and the US to stop funding the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) government.In June, Mr Tomas Tobé, the chairperson of the European Parliament's Development Committee, wrote to Josep Borrell Fontelles, the vice president of the European Commission High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, terming the enactment of the anti-homosexuality law as an unacceptable and "flagrant violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms"."The law will have far-reaching implications such as undermining progress in combating HIV and damaging the country's reputation as a destination for foreign investment and development assistance," Mr Tobé added.He called for action. "I urge the Commission, under your supervision, to ensure the EU sends a strong message to the Ugandan authorities that the EU will never accept anti-LGBTQI legislation or any type of legislation that violates human rights and fundamental freedoms".He added: "The EU must use all the tools available to it such as taking action under the 'essential elements' clause of the Cotonou Agreement, while also increasing support for Ugandan human rights defenders and lawyers seeking to challenge the law in court".Reprimand callIn response to the EU decision, Dr Frank Mugisha, a gay rights activist, and peace advocate, urged the EU to find alternatives for reallocating its financial assistance."An effective response is one that fine-tunes and reallocates EU assistance to Uganda in ways that ensure those who spout hatred and catalyse violence and discrimination against LGBTQI people—including Ugandan government officials—won't benefit from EU taxpayers' money," Dr Mugisha said.He added: "The dilemma presents the EU with a proper rostrum to have a legible say on the fate of queer minorities in Africa broadly. The law in Uganda is just a festering wound that will soon metastasise. So, the EU should tell us how it fights for queer rights".The EU is one of the top funders of the Ugandan government and cutting down on aid would seriously hamper many development projects.The EU also provides Uganda with humanitarian aid through the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG-ECHO).Jutta Urpilainen statement in full"The EU is leading the call for equality of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-sexual, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI) persons around the world, by implementing actions supporting their rights as per the LGBTQI Equality Strategy (2020-2025) and the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy (2020-2024). The EU continues to support LGBTQI equality in the multilateral fora and in bilateral meetings.The EU has expressed its deep concerns with the promulgation of the Ugandan Anti-Homosexuality Act. High-level EU officials have raised the issue with the Ugandan Government, Parliament and President.In this dialogue, the EU emphasised that the criminalisation of homosexuality is contrary to the principles of equality and non-discrimination in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the African Charter on Human and People's Rights.At this moment, the EU considers that a suspension of EU financial support to Uganda would deprive the most vulnerable populations, including LGBTQI persons, from vital support.Disengagement by the EU would also create gaps, which may be further filled by other players who do not share EU values.Therefore, the EU will continue to use all opportunities of engagement with the Ugandan authorities and civil society, including in the context of its development cooperation and broader partnership, to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity, are treated equally.In that perspective, the EU is stepping up its support to civil society and LGBTQI defenders, by promoting the universality of human rights and the principle of non-discrimination, and opposing the death penalty, with a specific focus on the protection of people and civil society organisations at risk."  2022 Nation Media Group Limited.

Uganda's autocratic leader has signed into force some of the world's fiercest anti-gay legislation, which includes the death penalty and puts the former British colony on a par with regimes enforcing sharia.
Ignoring pleas and pressures from donor states that finance more than half his country's budget, President Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, backed the law that stipulates life in jail for "promoting" homosexuality. Museveni, 78, urged MPs to resist "imperialist" pressure.
President Biden called the legislation a "tragic violation" of human rights and called on Uganda to repeal it immediately or risk losing aid and access to a preferential trade deal. Uganda receives billions of pounds in foreign aid each year.
"No one should live in constant fear for their life or of being subjected to violence and discrimination," Biden said. "This shameful Act is the latest development in an alarming trend of human rights abuses and corruption in Uganda."
Activists worry that Uganda's move will spur a new surge of intolerance, as new penalties are being proposed elsewhere on the continent. In Ghana legislation has been drafted that proposes criminalisation, with up to five years in prison for identifying as an LGBT person or for being in a gay relationship. More than 30 African countries have laws banning same-sex relationships.
Uganda had already outlawed homosexuality, but the new law extends the list of offences and imposes harsher penalties. There is a ban on disseminating information on LGBT issues. Anyone who knows someone who is gay is required to report them to the police or face six months in jail.
The inclusion of the death penalty for offences such as transmitting HIV, with no distinction between intentional and unintentional transmission, has drawn outrage. There have been dozens of reports by gay Ugandans of attacks, including arrests, sexual violence, evictions and being forcibly stripped in public.
Growing intolerance of homosexuality has been linked to lobbying and funding of modern-day, fundamentalist American missionaries operating on the continent.

Gay men can donate blood as ban informed by AIDS scourge is lifted

Restrictions prohibiting homosexual men from donating blood have been removed, deputy prime minister and health minister Chris Fearne said Friday.
"The discrimination employed – for patient safety – will no longer stand on blood donations, a pledge we made to electors in 2022," Fearne said.
The announcement comes three years since the ban was lifted in September 2019, after the National Blood Transfusion Service acquired advanced testing equipment.
"We now have equipment that is very sensitive and analyses blood very thoroughly. For this reason, from today, gay men will be allowed to donate blood and therefore there will no longer be any discrimination based on sexual orientation when it comes to blood donation," Fearne said.
Equality parliamentary secretary Rebecca Buttigieg said the Labour administration was committed to a more equal society. "This new blood donation protocol is a step forward for us. Gay men will no longer find closed doors when they make this generous step to donate blood."
Previously a deferral policy was used to reduce the risk of transmitting the HIV virus, which causes AIDS, when LGBTIQ people requested to donate blood.
Blood donation policies banning gay men were heavily influenced by the AIDS scourge of the 1980s. Sex between men was considered to be high risk by the health authorities and blood donation policies have taken time to evolve even as science has provided better blood testing techniques.
Gay rights activists argued that the ban on homosexual men was discriminatory and rather than targeting sexual orientation, health authorities should focus on risky behaviour, irrespective of who the potential donor is.
In 2016, the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that governments were allowed to ban – or restrict – homosexual blood donors if they could prove it was the best way to limit the risk of HIV infection.

When people hear the month of December, they start to think about Christmas, finals week, winter break or how they are going to survive with all of the Christmas music going around, but December is known for one more thing-December is also AIDS awareness month. For everyone that may not know exactly what AIDS is, AIDS is a disease that is caused by the HIV virus; it attacks a person's immune system, and in some cases, it is even fatal to the person (mayoclinic.org). 
HIV/AIDS is not just a thing of the past; it is a disease that is still running rampant today. Testing and treatment options have improved since the AIDS outbreak in the past; it is not a disease that has been cured, and it is not a disease that only happens to a select few people. HIV/AIDS, while being more common in the LGBTQIA+ community, does not mean that it is exclusive to only people who are LGBTQIA+; it can happen to anyone. 
Back in 1988, people gathered together to on Dec. 1 to fight against HIV/AIDS, to remember the people who were currently fighting it and as a memorial for those that had died because of the disease (worldsaidsday.org). Dec. 1 became known as World AIDS Day because of this. This day is important because it brings awareness to a disease that has a history of being ignored. In 2004, 1.7 million people died from AIDS; that number decreased to 1.2 million in 2010, and in 2018, it decreased to 770,000 who have died from AIDS (hiv.gov). Thankfully, the number of people who have died from this illness have decreased as the years go by.
AIDS has a history of being widespread in the LGBTQIA+ community. The first case of the AIDS virus was five gay men in Los Angeles (hiv.org). Since that first case study, the LGBTQIA+ community faced backlash, violence, and hate from others. People who were diagnosed with the virus were scorned from society, and in some cases HIV/AIDS was considered the wrath from god against the LGBTQIA+ community because of who they were and who they loved. The outbreak of the AIDS virus led to both anti-gay protests blaming the LGBTQIA+ community for the virus and gay rights protests against the lack of help and acknowledgement from the government and other people about this disease that kills thousands of people.
Overall, HIV/AIDS is a lifelong condition that cannot be cured. While the amount of backlash against people who have the virus has declined, and people are becoming more understanding. There are still people who choose to see AIDS as a plague against the LGBTQIA+ community rather than what it actually is-a disease that can kill those who are affected by it. The phrase "using protection" can mean more than avoiding getting pregnant. It also means protecting yourself against HIV/AIDS and being aware that stopping the spread of this disease starts with you.
Hailey Sauer is a junior psychology major planning on going into clinical or forensic psychology after graduation. Member of SAGA club on campus. In her free time she prefers to read a good book and watch Netflix. Any questions or comments about the article or the LGBTQIA+ community can be directed towards Hailey and may be discussed in further articles.

ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Abu Dhabi, this is CONNECT THE WORLD.
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Welcome to our second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Eleni Giokos, live in Abu Dhabi.
Emergency services in Taiwan are racing against time to rescue victims under the rubble after it was hit by an earthquake.
The deaths of seven aid workers in Gaza trigger outrage inside the White House and around the globe as well.
And the U.S. is pushing back against claims it was involved in an Israeli strike. The Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria. We will bring you the latest.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
GIOKOS: Taiwan has been hit by the strongest earthquake there in a quarter of a century. And we are closely following the aftermath. Officials say at least nine people are dead and more than 900 are injured. The 7.4 magnitude tremor shook the island's east coast earlier today.
It was followed by strong aftershocks and the powerful landslide as well. CNN's Ivan Watson has just arrived in Taipei and will bring us latest.
Now, Ivan, great to have you there.
What are you seeing and what are you hearing?
What's the latest?
IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, this earthquake, it hit about 14 hours ago, just before 8:00 am local time. And here in the capital in Taipei it was intense for residents here.
And this is about 160 kilometers away from the epicenter. For example, our camera man, he had glasses falling and he was rushing to protect his children and thought his TV would fall over.
Now the real damage and the loss of life is in this tourist region, in rugged mountains on the eastern coast, called Hualien. And it's around there that at least nine people have been killed and at least 934 people injured.
There are several buildings there that have collapsed. The authorities say that the residents there have by and large, been rescued, there have been big rescues throughout the day because there are tunnel networks for the highway that runs along the rugged east coast.
And there were scores of people who were trapped in different stretches of tunnels who have been successfully rescued.
But the authorities say there're still around 140 people that need rescuing, some working in a mine, others that are hotel workers, others that are tourists. This is a big tourist destination that people flock to because of the rugged topography there.
And that means that some of the fatalities have actually been people who were hiking and hit by falling rocks or, in one case, one individual killed driving on the highway by rocks falling down the mountain side and hitting them.
So the epicenter, this town of Hualien, which has a population of about 100,000 people -- I just got off the phone with somebody there. They said the electricity is working right now, that people are actually walking around and doing their shopping.
It's on the eve of the tomb sweeping holiday. That said, some parts of the town are roped off as the military and rescue workers are on the scene, working on collapsed buildings. So a big deal for this earthquake prone island.
But as you can see here at night, even after a 7.4 magnitude earthquake, the capital at the very least is back up and running almost as normal.
GIOKOS: Ivan Watson, great to have you there. Thank you so much for that update.
Now what started as a typical morning for many in Taiwan quickly turned terrifying. CNN's Hanako Montgomery looks at how the disaster unfolded.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Morning commuters in Taiwan shaken by strong tremors, drivers stopped on highways and bridges. Live broadcasts interrupted and people ducking for cover as a 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck the island around 8:00 am Wednesday.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): All the things fell off. Everything damaged.
MONTGOMERY (voice-over): It was the strongest earthquake to hit the island in 25 years. Taiwan's weather agency says.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): It was very strong, it felt as if the house was going to topple.
MONTGOMERY (voice-over): It prompted tsunami warnings in Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines, which were later lifted. Its epicenter near the tourist city of hualien on the island's eastern coast.
Social media video shows the moment it triggered a massive landslide with dust clouds swallowing a road.
This multistory building partially collapsing, as scooters and motorbikes watch from a distance.
[10:05:06]
Around 100 buildings have been damaged. Rescuers racing to save people trapped, including dozens in tunnels blocked by debris. Wednesday's quake is the strongest to hit Taiwan since 1999, when a powerful 7.7 magnitude quake struck, killing more than 2,000 people.
Authorities said Wednesday, the military has been deployed to help with the aftermath. President Tsai has asked her administration to work with local governments on assistance.
TSAI ING-WEN, TAIWANESE PRESIDENT (through translator): I would like to ask you to continue to pay close attention to the situation in various places and initiate various contingency measures to protect the safety of the people.
MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Many now find themselves in darkness, navigating the ruins of their homes and bracing for the relentless aftershocks -- Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Tokyo.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
GIOKOS: Providing help at the scene is the Tzu Chi Foundation. Rey-sheng Her is the organization's vice CEO and he's with us now from Hualien, which, of course, is where the epicenter of the earthquake occurred.
Welcome to the show. Thank you very much for joining us at this time. As we said, this was one of the most hardest hit where you are right. Now
Could you describe to us the aftermath of the earthquake?
REY-SHENG HER, VICE CEO, TZU CHI FOUNDATION: Yes. This is a very, very strong earthquake foreign. Hualien actually is a frequent earthquake zone. But this time it's quite different because shaking very long and very severe. And everybody know there's above 7 magnitude.
So Tzu Chi Foundation immediately mobilize avant use (ph) and other headquarter (ph) and organizen a coordinate center to gethering information at the start from 8 am. Today
And our founder, Thomasles also participate. The core donation to listen to different source of the victims and the collapse of the building. So this is quite a day. This is a lot of things happening right here.
GIOKOS: Indeed, indeed. I'm going to rescue operations still underway. There's still people that are trapped currently, especially near a mining area.
What are you hearing about the people that still need to be rescued?
Do you have any news on that?
REY-SHING: I -- we heard from the news media, of course. There's some hotel in the modern area, still some tourists still stuck in these mountain area because the collapse of the road and a railroad also collapse.
So and, of course, the somes (sic) people stuck in the collapse building now being evacuated. But one people, unfortunately, passed away.
GIOKOS: Yes, it's really sad.
I mean, 900 people that are injured right now.
Could you tell us how your organization is helping in the relief operation?
Are you assisting the injured?
Are you offering any kind of other assistance at this juncture?
REY-SHING: Yes. We mobilized more than 300 volunteers locally to support as hot meal (ph) and provide the blanket to all the victims. Is over she's hungry and low (ph). So are we giving the convertible folding bed for those rescuer as well as the victims and we also deliver the cash for the survival, especially those family who lost their home.
So it's about $US350 per household. And after all, we will provide something from 1,200 to 1,800 for each of the victims who lost their homes. So we still taking care of them --
(CROSSTALK)
GIOKOS: Yes, could you tell me --
REY-SHING: -- the hot meal and (INAUDIBLE) -- yes, yes. Yes, certainly.
GIOKOS: I'm just curious, you're saying you're helping people that have been displaced.
How many people are in need of assistance right now?
Because we have how many people died; we've got a grasp on how many people have been injured.
But how many people have been impacted as in having lost their homes right now?
REY-SHING: Our number is about 468 household being affected severely and need to be displaced or need to be shelter for them to stay a few days.
GIOKOS: In terms of emergency coordination and what else you need from an International perspective and assistance, tell me what, what is required at this point?
REY-SHING: Well, I believe the local government's quite efficiency as a city.
[10:10:00]
It's a quite significant number of volunteers and experiences to provide them the shelter, the hot meal, the everything they need. But for the evacuation or someone stuck in the building, now we haven't heard that many yet. But maybe in the mountain there is still some people say --
(AUDIO GAP)

REY-SHING: (INAUDIBLE).
GIOKOS: Yes, sorry. You broke up there for a second, Rey-Shing Her. Great to have you on the show and thank you very much for giving us a bit of insight in terms of what your organization is doing in Hualien, which, of course, has been one of the hardest hit areas in Taiwan. Great to have you on the show.
And still to come, we're following international outrage after Israel admits killing seven aid workers in Gaza. What we know about that deadly incident, that's coming up next.

GIOKOS: Welcome back.
And we're learning more about the deadly Israeli strike on aid workers in Gaza. World Central Kitchen says, seven of its workers were killed Monday, despite coordinating their movements with the IDF. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has more on the victims.
The outcry and what we know from the incident, we must warn you, some of the images in his report are graphic and very hard to watch.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): There is no mistaking the target of this Israeli strike. The World Central Kitchen's logo still visible after a missile tore through the roof of this vehicle. Pieces of the aid organization's emblem scattered throughout the charred hull of a second vehicle.
And then there are the bodies of the aid workers themselves. Patches proudly worn on chests over bulletproof vests that offer no more protection in Gaza than the emblem of a humanitarian aid organization.
They are among seven aid workers killed in Israeli strikes on their convoy late Monday night. Six of them were foreigners, including a dual American- Canadian citizen, as well as British, Australian and Polish nationals, triggering international uproar and prompting a rare apology from Israel's top general.
LT. GEN. HERZI HALEVI, CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: I want to be very clear. The strike was not carried out with the intention of harming WCKA workers. It was a mistake that followed a misidentification at night during a war in a very complex conditions. It shouldn't have happened.
DIAMOND (voice-over): World Central Kitchen says the Israeli military knew about the convoy and a weapons expert consulted by CNN said images of the damage indicate a precise drone strike carried out with total visibility of the target.
[10:15:04]
World Central Kitchen said its aid workers got into three vehicles after unloading aid at this warehouse in central Gaza and began traveling down the coastal al-Rashid Street.
CNN geolocated the convoy's deadly journey using images filmed at the scene: 3.5 miles south, a first vehicle is struck. Two other strikes rain down in quick succession. One vehicle is hit a half mile further. The third comes to a stop another mile down the road, found only the next day.
HASSAN AL SHURBAJI, EYEWITNESS (through translator): Last night between 11 and 11:30 pm, a missile hit a car. When we approached, we saw the car on fire. We tried to extinguish the fire.
And upon opening the car, we discovered boxes of canned meat. It was an international aid organization that assists people. Any international or European organization that comes to aid Gaza will be targeted. They want to send a message of don't come and let the people die.
DIAMOND (voice-over): The Israeli military has struck aid convoys in the past, including this U.N. truck, which was shelled in early February.
World Central Kitchen, founded in 2010 by celebrity chef Jose Andres, has been one of the most prominent aid organizations in Gaza, even working with the Israeli military last month to build a pier off the Gaza coastline, delivering the first aid shipments to Gaza by sea.
ZOMI FRANCOM, WORLD CENTRAL KITCHEN: Hey, this is Zomi and Chef Olivier.
DIAMOND (voice-over): Australian Zomi Frankcom spent years coordinating aid operations for World Central Kitchen, risking and ultimately sacrificing her life to help those in need. She died alongside her Polish colleague, Damien Sobel.
DAMIEN SOBEL, WORLD CENTRAL KITCHEN: Hello, everyone, Damien Sobel from Cairo.
DIAMOND (voice-over): Weeks earlier, he was excitedly readying a convoy to build soup kitchens in Gaza.
SOBEL: They already loaded tables, shelves, water systems.
DIAMOND (voice-over): Today, their bodies were among those headed for the Rafah border crossing. But the body of one of the seven will not leave Gaza. Saif Issam Abu Taha, a driver and translator, was buried in central Gaza, not far from where he carried out his final mission -- Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
GIOKOS: Meantime, CNN is told that this incident has boosted frustration within the White House to a new level.
In a blunt statement on Tuesday, U.S. President Biden said, and I quote, "I am outraged and heartbroken by the deaths of 70 humanitarian workers from World Central Kitchen, including one American in Gaza yesterday.
"They were providing food to hungry civilians in the middle of a war and they were brave and selfless. Their deaths are a tragedy."
Mr. Biden also acknowledged that this is not an isolated event, saying Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers. The U.N. says almost 200 humanitarian workers have been killed since this war began. Arlette Saenz is following the response from the White House for us.
Ggreat to see you. Strong words from the White House.
But does that mean consequences for Israel?
ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That is the big question at this moment, whether the Israeli airstrike, which targeted or which killed these seven humanitarian aid workers, whether that will lead to any change in the president's approach when it comes to supporting Israel as they wage their campaign against Hamas in Gaza.
But President Biden's statement released last night really amounted to some of his harshest criticism yet of Israel's operations in Gaza.
A senior administration official told CNN that the death of those seven World Central Kitchen workers, including one U.S.-Canadian dual citizen, that that really has raised the frustration of President Biden and his top advisors to new levels.
So that was evident in the statement released by the president last night, where the very first line he had was, quote, "I am outraged," a word that he has not used very frequently amid this conflict.
The president also, in his statement, called out Israel, saying they've not done enough to protect civilians or humanitarian aid workers in Gaza.
He said, quote, "This conflict has been one of the worst in recent memory in terms of how many aid workers have been killed. This is a major reason why distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza has been so difficult, because Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians.
"Incidents like yesterday's simply should not happen."
The president also spoke by phone with Jose Andres, the chef who founded World Central Kitchen, to extend his condolences for the lives lost, including that U.S. citizen.
But really, this incident lays bare the further tensions that have erupted between the U.S. and Israel. We have heard the president speaking quite stark language in recent weeks about the need for Israel to take more care to protect civilians.
[10:20:04]
That includes and planning for that operation that Israel intends to wage in Rafah. That is something the White House has been advising the Israeli officials that they need to find an alternative option plan for that.
And they've also been pressing Israel to help facilitate more humanitarian aid in to the war-torn enclave. Now the president is also facing domestic pressures here at home from Arab Muslim and young voters who are frustrated with his handling and unequivocal support for Israel and Netanyahu as they wage their campaign in Gaza.
But one of the big questions going forward is how the U.S. will respond to the deaths of these seven aid workers, whether it might trigger any type of different kind of response in this crisis.
We have seen and heard from sources that the U.S. has still -- has recently been planning to provide more weaponry to Israel as they are waging their campaign to root out Hamas.
But there are big questions about whether this will change any of that calculus going forward as the president is facing domestic pressure here at home and allies around the world have also expressed outrage about this.
GIOKOS: Arlette Saenz, thank you so much.
As political tensions continue to rise in the U.S. over the desperate situation in Gaza, a Palestinian American doctor walked out on a meeting with President Joe Biden. Now it happened Tuesday night as the president and other White House officials met with a small group of Muslim community leaders.
Dr. Thaer Ahmad is an emergency physician from Chicago, who traveled to Gaza earlier this year.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. THAER AHMAD, EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN: I let him know that I am from a community that's reeling. We are grieving and we -- our heart is broken for what's been taking place over the last six months.
And that the rhetoric that has been coming out of the Biden administration, that's been coming out of the White House, it's frustrated a lot of people, especially people who are Palestinian Americans, Muslim Americans, Arab Americans.
We are not satisfied with what has taken place. There have been no concrete steps. But keep in mind, we're very concerned about the people that are over in the Gaza Strip that are in Palestine right now, who are not just starving but are facing the threat of a looming Rafah invasion.
And so I was able to share that with the president and let him know that, out of respect for my community, out of respect for all of the people who have suffered and have been killed in the process, I need to walk out of the meeting.
And I want to walk out with decision-makers and let them know what it feels like for somebody to say something and then walk away from them and not hear them out and not hear their response.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GIOKOS: The U.S. is pushing back against claims it was involved in an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria. New satellite images show the dramatic before and after of that strike on Monday. Israel has not taken responsibility.
Now a top U.S. official is warning Iran against any retaliatory attacks against American forces in the region. The stark comments coming amid an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council. Fred Pleitgen is on top of the story for us with the latest.
Fred, good to see you. That emergency U.N. Security Council council meeting, there's ambassadors relaying concern about a potential escalation in the wider region. Even the U.S. signaled that they were concerned.
So what is the outcome of this overall meeting?
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you're absolutely right. The U.S. has said that it is concerned. And if you look at some of the things that the Iranians have said since that attack took place, it certainly seems as though there is going to be some sort of retaliation coming from the Iranians.
I think right now the big question is, will that retaliation be only against Israel or could it be against United States assets in the region as well?
Certainly it seems that the U.S. is very concerned about about that. You did mention that there was a top U.S. officials who came out and warned and said, look, all this could escalate the situation if indeed the Iranians retaliate in a very harsh form or retaliate at all.
Of course, we've had the supreme leader come out and said that there would be punishment. We've had the foreign minister of the Iranians come out and say that they hold the United States accountable for all of this as well.
I want to listen in to that U.N. Security Council council media -- meeting because the deputy Iranian ambassador to the U.N. there said that Iran does reserve the right to retaliate for those strikes. Let's listen in.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ZAHRA ERSHADI, DEPUTY IRANIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: Given the grave repercussions of this reprehensible act, which could escalate tensions in the region and potentially a spark further conflict involving other nations, we call on the Security Council to vehemently condemn this unjustified criminal act and terrorist attack.
Iran reserve is legitimate and inherit right under international law and the United Nations charter, to take a decisive response to such reprehensible acts.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PLEITGEN: So there you have the Iranians speaking about a decisive response and that's certainly something that we've heard from top-level Iranian officials over the past 24 hours or so as well. Quite an interesting position there from the U.S.
[10:25:02]
The U.S. does say that they are confident that the Israelis were behind the strike on that embassy compound. The Israelis, of course, have not acknowledged that yet but also said that they didn't consider it to be an embassy compound.
That is, of course, very much within the greater area of the Iranian embassy that I've been to a couple of years ago. The U.S., however, not saying that they know what kind of compound this actually was. They did say that they knew that there were some top-level IRGC officials who were inside that building who were killed.
However, they said that they did not know who it was. And most importantly, Eleni, the U.S. saying that they were not informed beforehand that a strike would take place or what the target of any strike would be.
I want to listen in to the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ROBERT WOOD, U.S. DEPUTY AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: We do not yet have confirmation of the status of the building that was struck in Damascus. Any confirmed attack on property that was in fact a diplomatic facility would be of concern to the United States.
Diplomatic missions and their property, as well as official diplomatic residences, must be protected, even and especially in times of armed conflict.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PLEITGEN: The U.S. there saying that they do not condone any sort of attacks on diplomatic facilities. Again, as right now, we are waiting to see if, when and how the Iranians are going to respond to this attack.
GIOKOS: Fred Pleitgen, great as always, thank you so much.
Now in London, police say they have identified three men suspected of stabbing an exiled Iranian television journalist but also say the men managed to flee the country within hours of the attack.
Pouria zeraati, an anchor at the U.K.-based channel Iran International, was attacked outside his home on Friday. He's recovering from leg injuries. Shortly after the attack a senior Iranian diplomat posted on social media denying any link and, quote, "this story of the so called journalist."
Protests in eastern Turkiye after authorities reportedly said a newly elected mayor cannot take office. They'd ruled that last minute and that abdula zaidan of the pro Kurdish party was not eligible to stand.
They replaced him with the runner up, a member of the ruling AK Party or the AK Party suffered big hits in Sunday's local elections.
The city of Istanbul, meantime, is reeling from a deadly fire and looking for answers. This is what's left of a night club after Tuesday's blaze, 29 people who were working on renovations there were killed. Nine people have now been arrested and CNN's Scott McLean tells us how it all unfolded.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The camera tremembles as neighbors capture the raging fire across the road. Hours later, the human cost becomes tragically apparent as firefighters pull bodies out one by one.
All afternoon police, investigators and exhausted firefighters came and went, wondering what went wrong. All told, at least 29 people were killed. All of them were workers doing renovations on a nightclub housed in the bottom of this 16-story apartment block.
The slick Masquerade nightclub looks out of place on the ordinary- looking residential street.
Sama Soanja (ph) lives now next door and heard screams when the fire first started. "I used to go to the nightclub from time to time," she says. "The bar had one entrance and an exit. There's only one way in and one way out."
MCLEAN: From here, you can see quite clearly where the fire would have started on these lower floors and then raced up the side of this building.
There have been several people detained already as part of this investigation, including the business manager of the club and the person responsible for doing the metalwork renovation inside.
Now in addition to the fire crews on scene, there are also three occupational safety experts here doing their own investigation into what went wrong.
MCLEAN (voice-over): Across the road, the neighbors invite us to see the aftermath from their vantage point. They asked not to be identified.
"It's like a maze inside. There are so many casualties, because they couldn't escape," she says. "The workers were kids trying to earn a bit of money. I cried a lot, because I saw these young guys entering the club in the morning before I went to the doctor. I am so sorry this happened" -- Scott McLean, CNN, Istanbul.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
GIOKOS: And still to come, Al-Shifa hospital in ruins. Officials say the complex is permanently out of service after a two-week Israeli siege. We speak to a surgeon who has worked inside the hospital under harrowing conditions.
Concerns for human rights in Uganda after a court refuses to overturn the country's anti-gay laws. We will bring you an update on that story.

GIOKOS: Welcome back. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Eleni Giokos. Here are your headlines this hour.
Officials say at least nine people were killed and more than 900 others injured after the strongest earthquake to hit Taiwan in 25 years. Crews are trying to rescue about 137 trapped people. The majority of them are in a mining area.
The killing of seven aid workers by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza on Monday is sparking international condemnation. U.S. President Joe Biden said, Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers and civilians.
Israeli Defense Forces have apologized for the attack, saying it was a grave mistake. World Central Kitchen says the aid workers who were killed were heroes who died in what it calls a targeted attack.
Meantime, the director of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza says the complex is permanently out of service. It comes after a 14 day Israeli siege, which saw widespread destruction.
Now Dr. Ghassan Abu Sittah is a British Palestinian surgeon who has worked inside Shifa Hospital. He joins us now, live.
Dr. Ghassan, great to have you with us. Thank you so much for taking the time today. I want to talk firstly, about the World Central Kitchen and the outrage, the strong denunciation of this -- the strike, specifically from Joe Biden, using words we've rarely heard.
Outrage, for example; how do you feel as a British Palestinian hearing the international condemnation?
You have repeatedly spoken about the horrors that you have witnessed and what you've called international silence that follows.
DR. GHASSAN ABU SITTAH, BRITISH PALESTINIAN SURGEON: For me, first of all, my heart goes out to the families of the aid workers. I remember -- I remember was what I was (INAUDIBLE) be true and the worry that they went through every day when the hospitals that I worked in were being shelled.
[10:35:06]
And so my condolences go out to these families in this really difficult time. I think the outrage globally is that we are historically at a turning point. We either accept that there is no rules that --
(AUDIO GAP)
GIOKOS: All right.
(CROSSTALK)
GIOKOS: Dr. Ghassan, we -- you're breaking up quite badly. Your internet is really intermittent. I'm wondering if you can try and just establish a better connection. We really want to speak to you.
Is there a way we could perhaps fix that line and come back to you as soon as we can?
We'll try it and reestablish that.
I just -- in the meantime, I just want to give the next word on our coverage of the aid workers and the story that has been playing out today. And specifically the words of Jose Andres, the founder of World Central Kitchen.
He wrote an op-ed in "The New York Times," with the headline, "Let People Eat."
In it, Andres references the 43 million meals his organization has served to people in Gaza, far short of what is needed but absolutely crucial. And he talked about the nearly 2 million meals they've served in Israel, to Israelis displaced by shelling in the north and in hospitals where hostages were reunited with their families.
Jose Andres says he knows Israel.
And he wrote this, and we quote, "Israel is better than the way this war is being waged. It is better than blocking food and medicine to civilians. It is better than killing aid workers, who had coordinated their movements with the Israel Defense Forces."
Andres begins his piece by pointing out that, quote, "The seven people killed on a World Central Kitchen mission in Gaza on Monday were the best of humanity."
And he concludes by saying, "It is not a sign of weakness to feed strangers. And in fact, it is a sign of strength. The people of Israel need to remember, at this darkest hour,1 what strength truly looks like.
We'll be right back after this short break. Stay with CNN.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
GIOKOS: Welcome back. And I want to return now to Dr. Ghassan Abu Sittah who's a British Palestinian surgeon, who's worked inside Al-Shifa Hospital.
And Dr. Ghassan, we were talking about World Central Kitchen and the strong condemnations, particularly out of the U.S.
What is your response to the fact that finally we've been seeing a coordinated response of condemnation from the West?
GHASSAN: I think we are historically at a juncture.
[10:40:00]
We either move forward into a rules-based world, where international rule is applied, regardless of who the perpetrator is and who the victim is, or we leave this war behind us and we move into a world where the killing of 15,000 children is acceptable; the targeting of aid workers is acceptable; the targeting of hospitals is acceptable.
And all of the consensus that has developed around the conduct of war since the Second World War ends. As flawed as it was, at least we agreed that that --
(AUDIO GAP)
GHASSAN: -- the targeting of these aid workers, in this calculated way -- three attacks on three cars of aid workers, that had given all of their coordinates to the Israeli army -- would then be attacked in that way.
So it's beyond time that this is done. We need to apply international law regardless of who the perpetrator is if we are going to live in a world where these things do not happen and where aid workers, who put their lives align (sic), feel at least that there is some rules that govern the conduct of war.
GIOKOS: So, Dr. Ghassan WCK suspending operations there shortly after that announcement, the American Near East Refugee Aid Agency also suspending operations on Rafah, restricted from working in northern Gaza.
This is at a time where there are again international calls for more aid into Gaza. You've got a team of colleagues on the ground right now through an NGO called Anera (ph).
What are they telling you right now and how dire is the hunger situation?
GHASSAN: So our organization Anera (ph) provides aid for children affected by war. And at the moment, we're running soup kitchens southern part of Gaza. And we're desperately trying to reach the north, where there is, according to all U.N. agencies, a famine.
And the suspension of aid into the north by the World Central Kitchen means that that famine, that man-made famine, is going to deepen. It's going to take the lives of more children. And it's going to alter permanently the health of thousands of other children, whom we do not see.
We know that that's from famine only representative of the iceberg. And the children, whose health is permanently altered as a result of that malnutrition, go on to lead lives where, as adults, they're more likely to develop chronic illnesses. They're less likely to achieve cognitive milestones as they're growing.
And so the attack on these aid workers is going to further deepen this famine and further damage the health and lives of these children. You know, our --
(CROSSTALK)
GIOKOS: Al-Shifa --
GHASSAN: -- go ahead, sorry.
GIOKOS: Yes, sorry. For the sake of time, I also want to talk about Al- Shifa. You worked at Al-Shifa. I mean, looking at the images of the aftermath of the IDF siege is really devastating to see the destruction of the building but also the harrowing stories.
You, sadly, lost a colleague and a friend and you paid tribute to him on social media, Dr. Ahmad Maqadmeh.
When was the last time you spoke to him?
And what was he relaying to you during the siege?
GHASSAN: So Dr. Maqadmeh was one of the most dedicated surgeons, a young surgeon who decided to stay in the north to provide badly needed care to over 600,000 people who were still there.
And he would shuttle between the different hospitals that were still functioning in the north (ph) and were sending us consultations, images of the surgeries that he needed to do, to get second opinions.
Leading -- once the attack on Shifa by the Israeli army became underway, he contacted us (ph) and his family to say that he's going to leave Shifa Hospital. And his family was on the line to him as he was escaping with his mother and cousin away from Shifa.
And then the phone was cut. And devastatingly today -- and video images emerged of the last message that he was sending his family as he was walking away from Shifa Hospital.
When the Israelis withdrew, his family went to the area where the connection was lost and found his body and that of his mother and cousin.
[10:45:03]
And they had been shot by sniper gunshots.
GIOKOS: Absolutely devastating to hear the story. I want to move on to, most recently, you've been elected as rector of Glasgow University, an overwhelming victory of 80 percent of the votes.
What are your priorities as you take on this role?
Firstly, it's interesting in terms of the overwhelming votes that you received. But secondly, what you ran on as well, Palestinian solidarity. We also know that Glasgow University does have investments in companies that do trade in military equipment and arms.
How are you going to deal with that?
GHASSAN: So there are two issues here at hand. One more (ph), an institute of higher education, institute of learning should not be an owner of a business that manufactures weapons -- and full stop.
Two, in terms of risk, if the International Court of Justice ruling, that this is a genocidal war, then Glasgow University, like all owners of shares in weapons manufacturers, is liable to become complicit in future litigation in genocide.
And so it's critical to de-risk the university and get it to move away from relying on shares in weapons manufacturing.
The other issue at hand is the profits, the blood money that the university made out of these shares during this war. These need to be set aside for a victims' fund to help rebuild the Palestinian health sector, help rebuild the Palestinian academic sector.
You know, the -- Dr. Tedros, the head of the WHO, when he was last at Glasgow University, paid tribute to Dima Alhaj, a Glasgow University alumni, who was a WHO employee and was killed with her family in Gaza.
So that we honor her memory in Glasgow University by setting up a fund for the victims of this war.
GIOKOS: Dr. Ghassan Abu Sittah, good to have you on. Thank you very much for sharing your insights with us. Was good to speak to you, much appreciated. Thank you, sir.
Now a court in Uganda has blocked an attempt to overturn what have been described as some of the harshest anti-gay laws in the world. Last year, the government passed laws to outlaw gay marriage and brought in a sentence of up to life imprisonment for same-sex acts.
Human rights activists had asked Uganda's constitutional court to throw out the laws but the five judges have refused to do so. The petitioners are vowing to appeal the supreme court. I want to bring in David McKenzie, who's been following the story for us.
David, good to see you.
Firstly, was this a surprise move and what else -- what other options do they have in terms of trying to overturn this law?
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Eleni, they can go to the Supreme Court of Uganda but, given that court today, the constitutional court, largely upheld this draconian anti LGBTQ law that was signed last year by president Museveni, they may have an uphill battle.
The leading activist for the LGBTQ community arguably just said a short time ago that this ruling was wrong and deplorable.
One of the leading attorneys who argued the case in the constitutional court said that he believed that the court worked on issues of public discourse and public opinion rather than on issues of human rights and the constitution.
So, yes, I expect them to appeal this decision. But sometimes you can get caught up in the legalese. The impact of this law even before it was signed, has been devastating on the LGBTQ community in Uganda and, in fact, in the region.
People have been evicted from their homes, thrown out of their place of work; in some cases, aren't able to access health care. We spoke to Ugandans who fled the country into neighboring Kenya to try and get asylum as part of an extensive investigation late last year.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ADRIAN, ASYLUM SEEKER: He felt like if he can cut me into pieces, it would be better.
MCKENZIE (voice-over): Adrian's own father tried to kill him, he says, for being gay.
ADRIAN: These knives, he stabbed me. In Uganda, when they kill someone in a LGBT community, it's not a big deal.
SYLVIA, ASYLUM SEEKER: My mom came herself and she told me, you know what, you are not welcome here. You are not part of our family.
[10:50:00]
MCKENZIE: Many of those Ugandans we spoke to then are still trying to get asylum and Kenya is in fact potentially going to have its own law that will go to parliament along similar lines.
We investigated the linkages or alleged linkages to U.S. right-wing groups. Certainly this is something that is impacting many, many Africans across the continent.
And this latest decision by the constitutional court will be another decision, a legal one, that will solidify this law, that many say is making the lives of ordinary Ugandans miserable and untenable in some cases.
GIOKOS: Yes, absolutely. David, great to have you on this. Thank you so much. David McKenzie in Johannesburg.
And still to come, not sure the best spot to catch Monday's solar eclipse?
We will have the latest forecast as tens of millions of North Americans get caught up in eclipse mania.

GIOKOS: Welcome back. I'd like to take you now to Brussels, where NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg is currently speaking. Let's listen in.
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: Russians, who are now able to outgun them with more weapons and more ammunition than Ukrainians have. So we have a responsibility as NATO allies to take the decisions and to ensure that Ukrainians get ammunition.
They must have it to be able to continue to push back the Russian invaders. So it is urgent that the United States make a decision. And the U.S. Congress actually is able to turn the majority in the U.S. public but also in the U.S. Congress into a concrete decision.
Because every time I meet representatives from the U.S. Congress -- I met many of them over the last weeks -- they assured me that it is a majority in the U.S. and also the U.S. Congress for support. But so far they haven't been able to turn that majority into a decision.
And that's exactly what we all now are waiting for. And it is urgent.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you.
Thomas, from TASS.
QUESTION: Thanks a lot. Thomas Pushkin (INAUDIBLE).
Secretary general on the ammunition question, we've heard from the Czech foreign minister today that they still lack funding for their initiative to provide Ukraine on a short-term basis with 155 artillery ammunition.
Have there been any signals today in the room that allies are willing to step up their short-term commitments or have there been concrete commitments toward that?
And the second question, President Zelenskyy last week has warned that if they don't get U.S. support, they might have to retreat.
How big do you assess the risk of a Russian breakthrough in the next month?
Thank you.
STOLTENBERG: Support from NATO allies and support from the United States to Ukraine is something which benefits our own security interests. It is therefore in the security interests of the United States to make a decision and provide Ukraine with ammunition.
Because by allocating a fraction of their defense budgets we have enabled the Ukrainians to destroy significant parts of the Russian combat capability without putting any NATO soldier or any U.S. soldiers in harm's way.
[10:55:06]
So this is really something that is in our interest to continue to do. Not only continue to do but to do more, to step up and to ensure that we do it in a predictable, robust way for long haul.
That's exactly also why we are now discussing how can we establish a more robust and institutional NATO framework around this support to make it more predictable, more long term and also to ensure fair burden sharing.
But why we are of course, discussing this as NATO -- and I expect the decision by the summit, I welcome the fact that we are now agree to start planning-- of course, we need also immediate support.
And therefore, I urge allies to continue and to step up, to make national contributions. And recently, we have had the German announcement of 500 --
(CROSSTALK)
GIOKOS: Right, Jens --
STOLTENBERG: -- meters --
GIOKOS: -- right, so NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg there, speaking in Brussels, urging for allies to step up and make more contributions and also talking about a more predictable and robust way to support Ukraine.
Well, thank you so much for joining us for CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Eleni Giokos. Stay with CNN. NEWSROOM is up next.

Highlight: Biden decries ‘tragic violation’ of human rights
Body


Uganda’s autocratic leader has signed into force some of the world’s fiercest anti-gay legislation, which includes the death penalty and puts the former British colony on a par with regimes enforcing sharia.
Ignoring pleas and pressure from donor states that finance more than half his country’s budget, President Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, backed the law that stipulates life in jail for “promoting” homosexuality. Museveni, 78, urged MPs to resist “imperialist” pressure.
President Biden
 called the legislation a “tragic violation” of human rights and called on Uganda to repeal it immediately or risk losing aid and access to a preferential trade deal. Uganda receives billions of pounds in foreign aid each year.
“No one should live in constant fear for their life or of being subjected to violence and discrimination,” Biden said. “This shameful Act is the latest development in an alarming trend of human rights abuses and corruption in Uganda.”
Activists worry that Uganda’s move will spur a surge of intolerance, as penalties are being proposed elsewhere on the continent. In Ghana legislation has been drafted that proposes criminalisation, with up to five years in prison for identifying as an LGBT person or for being in a gay relationship. More than 30 African countries have laws banning same-sex relationships.
Uganda had already 
outlawed homosexuality
, but the new law extends the list of offences and imposes harsher penalties. There is a ban on disseminating information on LGBT issues. Anyone who knows someone who is gay is required to report them to the police or face six months in jail.
The inclusion of the death penalty for offences such 
as transmitting HIV
, with no distinction between intentional and unintentional transmission, has drawn outrage.
There have been dozens of reports by gay Ugandans of attacks, including arrests, sexual violence, evictions and being forcibly stripped in public.
Growing intolerance of homosexuality has been linked to lobbying and funding of modern-day, fundamentalist American missionaries operating on the continent.

Men at Ken's Karate Klub, Kensington in 1977. William Yang
Review: William Yang's Sydneyphiles Reimagined, State Library of New South Wales.
We are all photographers now, since the advent of smartphones and the selfie. So it may seem strange to be writing a review of an exhibition of photographs when, in their digital form, they are both ubiquitous and at the same time largely redundant.
William Yang's photographs in Sydneyphiles offer the complete opposite of the selfie. Instead of the throwaway image, he offers carefully framed and curated portraits.
In his famous slideshow performances, he narrates the events behind the pictures and names the subjects so they are not forgotten or discarded. In doing this, Yang also ensures he is still part of the picture, just as he is a part of the community of artists and gay radicals he has lived among and photographed. He brings the pictures back into the present moment.

Alternative Sydney up close
William Yang (pronounced Young but he says he doesn't care anymore) is 80 this year. He has seen the alternative cultures of Sydney up close, in a way few people alive have.
He never goes far without his cameras, shooting social events over the past 50 years for the social pages of newspapers and fashion magazines.
              Linda Jackson, 1976.                William Yang              
Yang has an extensive visual record of Sydney cultural life, beginning with his first ever exhibition of photographs, Sydneyphiles. Sydneyphiles was shown at the then ACP gallery in Oxford Street, Paddington in 1977, documenting the mainstream Sydney social scene and the then illegal gay party scene in the years since his arrival in Sydney in 1969.
It is a priceless resource, as the State Library of NSW has recognised having purchased the collection. It has now been remounted in its entirety as a part of Sydney World Pride 2023. Pride's theme, Mana Nangamai Djuralli, means "Gather, Dream, Amplify" in Gadigal language. It is an especially apt theme for this exhibition.
Portraits and private parties
More than 200 images, mostly portraits, are on display: celebrities such as Brett Whiteley, Kate Fitzpatrick, Jackie Weaver, Penelope Seidler, Robyn Nevin among many others alongside candid shots with titles such as "Men Fucking" and "Gary Injecting Junk".
              Sleeping men.                William Yang              
Others with captions such as "Untitled no 1 (men sleeping)" reveal two naked young men spooning in post-coital slumber in the basement of a house party. Another image "Doris Fish with man in bondage gear" shows the eponymous drag queen Doris performing fellatio on the man - viewers get much more than the label suggests.
Many are shots taken at private parties such as those held by Madame Lash in her warehouse. These pictures feature guests tied to a rack surrounded by crowds of party-goers. It is a part of Sydney's recent cultural history that few people still alive have witnessed.
              Madam Lash's rack party, 1977.                William Yang              
Many of Yang's subjects were lost to the AIDS epidemic, powerfully captured in his photographs and performances in unforgettably moving works such as Sadness and Friends of Dorothy. That's what makes this an important exhibition for Sydney in this year of World Pride.
Gay liberation
Yang's work also features in The Party currently at UNSW Galleries, another significant exhibition of Sydney gay visual culture for Sydney World Pride.
This covers the years beginning with the inaugural Mardi Gras in 1978, a protest march for gay rights that became infamous for the brutality of the NSW police, to now.
The changes could not be more stark. Mardi Gras is now and has been for some time (for those living under a rock) a celebration and affirmation of LGBTQI culture and identity with the NSW Police participating.
Yang refers to these as the years of "gay liberation" and is justly proud of his role in recording this extraordinary transition of gay life from illegality to recognition and celebration.

Open hearts and minds
It was a treat to see him present the photographs to a packed house at a one-off recital at the State Library on February 10.
He has performed his quiet storytelling alongside his pictures since 1989 and was recently awarded a Life Time Achievement Award by the Sydney Theatre Critics Circle. The power of these simple shows, as Helena Grehan and I wrote about them some years ago, is that they open onto "vast as well as minute landscapes of grief, love, loss and friendship".
              'Stiletto Oscars' party at Kingo's (Peter Kingston), 1976.                William Yang              
In presenting Sydneyphiles, the slideshow, he evinced a new level of quiet defiance and a newly stated sense of purpose for his work. He expressed "no regrets or apologies" for the radical lifestyle he so eloquently captures and an assertiveness of the value of his work in making the gay and lesbian community of that time visible.
He offers a valuable reminder of a time when these gatherings had to be held in secret. His work stands as a contestation and a refusal of this - and a softly spoken demand that our societies, hearts and minds remain open.
Sydneyphiles is at State Library of NSW until June 4.

 https://eadn-wc03-7998482.nxedge.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Tina-Knowles-Filmmagic-Getty.jpgTina Knowles (Filmmagic-Getty) *Tina Knowles appeared in the ABC News special 'Viral: A World Without Aids' on Thursday as she emotionally remembered her nephew, Johnny, recounting the moment she found out he had been diagnosed with AIDS. During the episode, the mother-of-two said she learned about the heartbreaking news at a hospital, shortly after Johnny had fallen sick. Tina deemed Johnny her 'best friend' growing up, who even helped raise her daughters, Beyonce and Solange. 
When she learned of his diagnosis, Tina was left in shock since she knew that contracting HIV and/or AIDS at the time that the virus had been detected in his body meant that the person in question was going to die. Johnny had a tremendous impact on not just Tina's life but also the lives of Beyonce and Solange, who were so close to him that they regarded Johnny as their uncle. 'Johnny was a light,' the 68-year-old said. 
'Johnny was the funniest person in the whole world.' Aside from being close family members, Tina revealed that she also bonded with Johnny over all things concerning fashion, make-up, and hair, adding, 'He made me laugh more than anybody else that I've seen in my life.' 
Speaking of the time she found out about his AIDS diagnosis, she added, 'I went to see him, he had no forewarning. I told him that he would never be alone and that everybody would be there with him because, at the time, when people were diagnosed, they died.'

In recognition of National Gay Men's HIV/AIDS Awareness Day (taking place tomorrow, September 27), Whittier Street Health Center will be providing a Resource Table in the Main Lobby (at 1290 Tremont Street in Roxbury) from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., as well as offering Free Sexual Health Screenings and HIV Testing, available from 8:30 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., on Tuesday, September 27. The screenings and testing will also be available at the 1290 Tremont Street location.

Members of the media looking to gain more information about National Gay Men's HIV/AIDS Awareness Day and/or speak with a medical professional are welcome to attend, or to contact Nicole Hales at nhales@prfirst.com or 617-947-7983.

National Gay Men's HIV/AIDS Awareness Day is a day to help end HIV stigma and encourage HIV testing, prevention, and treatment among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. Observed each year on September 27, the day allows us to reflect on the continuing and disproportionate impact that HIV has had on gay and bisexual men over the past three decades and remember those we have lost, as well as to acknowledge the many contributions of gay and bisexual men, including their tireless activism on behalf of those at risk for and living with HIV.

Of the estimated 36,400 new HIV infections in the United States in 2018, 67% (24,400) were among gay and bisexual men. Among these men, racial and ethnic differences exist, with the highest disparity found among Black and Latino gay and bisexual men. Compared to 2014, in 2018, new HIV infections were down 20% among white gay and bisexual men and remained stable among Black and Latino gay and bisexual men.

2023 MAY 01 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Current study results on HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news originating from Los Angeles, California, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Healthcare stereotype threat (HCST) is defined as “being reduced to group stereotypes within an individual's healthcare encounter,” leading to experiences of stigma and discrimination." 
 Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University of Southern California: "This current study explores how older gay men living with HIV attribute their healthcare experiences to their social identities. Using HCST as a guiding framework, a content and structural coding analysis was conducted on transcripts from 11 interviews of older gay men living with HIV. The majority of HCST experiences were connected to the social identities of sexual orientation, HIV status, and age. Many of the healthcare experiences that participants discussed were related to interactions with healthcare providers and the attitudes of healthcare providers." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "This study illustrates how participants attributed social identities to healthcare experiences that showed qualities of HCST. These outcomes highlight how marginalized social identities impacted the lifetime healthcare experiences of this group of older gay men living with HIV."

Ben Williams opens up a blue shoebox, and history comes pouring out.
Specifically, Williams, 71, has become the chronicler of the history of Utah's LGBTQ+ community - much of which he has experienced as a young Brigham Young University student who was kicked out for being gay, and later during the AIDS epidemic of the '80s when he decided to come out.
In the box, he carries bits and pieces of the history he's kept. There's an award from Dr. Kristen Ries, who was the only doctor in Utah willing to treat HIV patients during the worst of the AIDS epidemic. There's an educational poster about AIDS, which he kept from his days as an elementary school teacher in Davis County. And there's a dusty block, a lifetime achievement award the Utah Pride Center gave him in 2019.
There's the 2015 certificate, for outstanding contribution, given to him by the Utah State Historical Society - which, Williams said, was the "first acknowledgment of [the existence] of a gay community from a state agency."
As an LGBTQ+ historian in Utah, Williams said, he has seen the state's community develop since the 1970s, and he has documented it all. He started keeping a journal when he was 16, in 1968 - the year of the Tet Offensive, of student protests against the Vietnam War, and of the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.
"I always felt that there's going to be a time where Utah's going to rewrite history and say how much they loved gay people, Black people, people of color and everything else," Williams said. "I wanted to have a record of saying, 'No, we fought. Everybody that has any rights today, fought tooth and nail to get anything here in Utah.'"
That fight, Williams said, was a "magnificent struggle" and though he's glad times have changed, it's important to remember "you can't change the past."(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Ben Williams, a queer community historian in Utah, characterizes the ongoing fight the LGBTQ community faces as a "magnificent struggle." A former elementary school teacher for 28-years, Williams holds one of the posters he kept in his classroom during the 80's AIDS epidemic to help students be less fearful as part of the required health curriculum at the time. (Francisco Kjolseth/)
The good, the bad and the ugly
Williams said he kept a journal because he knew what was happening around him in Utah, and beyond, was historic. "Very few cities can trace the origin of their gay community, not only the origins, but who the people involved were," he said.
Many of those journal entries have been chronicled in Q Salt Lake Magazine and on his blog "This Day in Gay Utah History."
Williams was raised in southern California and converted to the Latter-day Saint faith as a teenager. "I look back now on it and it was mostly to overcome my homosexuality," Williams said of his conversion. In high school, he said he remembers being in love with a boy named John who didn't love him back.
That heartbreak, and the general shame associated with homosexuality at the time, made life difficult.
"I tried to come out at Cal State-Fullerton in 1971, but there was no support back then," he said. "I was fairly religious and I thought, 'This is not what God wanted me to be,' and everybody I knew that was gay in California were Mormons."
His family didn't convert, he said, and was accepting that he did. Homosexuality wasn't something his family talked about. Once, he recalled, he was upset about telling a different boy that he was gay. Williams said his mother tried to comfort him, without knowing he was gay, and the conversation got awkward.
"I had to comfort her by not telling her that her son was queer," he says.
In 1973, he started attending Brigham Young University - the Provo college owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - but was kicked out in 1976, when the school learned he was gay.
During his time at BYU, records show, the university was performing shock therapy on students as a "gay cure" - something Latter-day Saint apostle Dallin H. Oaks denied in 2021, despite the records.
Williams's time at BYU, he said, was a "homophobic witch hunt period" - and he said he knew of two "purges" of homosexuals from campus. He was never called in for shock treatment, but he said he knew it was happening.
Someone he was involved with was caught by the university - which, according to Williams, said they wouldn't expel the man if he informed on others. Williams said the man didn't rat him out.
But when Williams later met with his bishop, he said he couldn't take the shame any more and confessed. Williams eventually was kicked out of BYU, without getting his teaching credentials.
In 1977, Williams did what many gay men in the Latter-day Saint faith had done at the time He got married to a woman, to "get back into the good graces of the church. ... The church at that time was telling you that marriage was a cure for homosexuality."
Williams said living with internalized shame was what inspired him to become an activist. "I wanted to get rid of people having this sense of shame," he said. "I realized the power society had over us. They equated what we were doing with prostitution and pedophilia. ... They preached homosexuality was a sin next to murder."
When asked if he regrets his decision to convert, he doesn't answer "yes" or "no." Like most things, it's complicated.
"I never would have come to Utah and been a Utah gay historian if I hadn't found the Mormon church," Williams said. Though there was some wasted energy, as he put it, "in some psychic kind of cosmic way, it saved me from AIDS."
It was Dr. Ries who diagnosed Utah's first case of AIDS, sometime in 1981 or 1982. In 1985, the Utah AIDS Foundation was founded. The gay community, stricken by grief, rallied together.
"Not only were we fighting for our civil rights, we were fighting for our lives," Williams said. "The state wouldn't do anything, they wouldn't allocate from the health department a dime for the gay community, even for education."
Instead, Williams says it all came from grassroots organizations that the local gay and lesbian community created.
As "we were dying left and right," Williams said, he decided to chronicle the epidemic. "I thought, 'I had to preserve this for my friends that were not going to be around to tell their stories.' They were all young men, having a good time. They were fun, vibrant and they were gone," he said.
He started cross-checking his journal entries with newspaper archives, like those of The Tribune. "I thought as a historian that was my job. If I'm going to pass away, I want my journals, records and archival things preserved," he said.
In the mid-'80s, in the midst of the AIDS epidemic, Williams decided to come out, at age 34.
"I wanted to live an authentic life," Williams said. "I had some kind of epiphany saying the reason I was so unhappy all my life was because I was rejecting this gift that God gave me, that my homosexuality was not a curse. It was a gift that made me more sensitive, loving and kind. ... It made me a better person."
Stonewall comes to Salt Lake City
Williams said gay liberation came to Salt Lake City in October 1969, only a few months after the riots at the Stonewall Inn in New York City, seen generally as the beginning of the gay-rights movement.
The ripples from Stonewall were felt nationally, mostly through college campuses, Williams said. In Salt Lake City, there were also people with progressive ideologies - such as Ralph Place, the founder of the state's first gay organization; Joe Redburn, the radio host who founded two of Salt Lake City's iconic gay bars, The Sun and The Trapp; and Linda Huntington, whose bohemian store Mother's Earth Things anchored the funky 9th and 9th business district.
The community in Salt Lake City started small, with less than a hundred active members in 1970, Williams said.
"One of their first activities they went to was an anti-war march in October of 1969," he said. "They had a war moratorium across the nation, and they had a big peace rally at Pioneer Park." The psychedelic rock band Country Joe and the Fish, which had played at Woodstock just two months earlier, performed in the park.
In 1973, Redburn opened The Sun, which Williams called the first real gay bar in Utah. (Technically, Radio City Lounge on State Street predated The Sun by a decade.) Redburn also provided the kegs for an under-the-radar party at Bare Ass Beach, a nude bathing spot; the event became known as Utah's first Pride celebration, Williams said.(Ben Williams) The Sun Tavern bar, a former LGBTQ bar in Salt Lake City, in an undated photograph.
Soon after that, gay student unions started popping up. The mainstream news outlets in Utah wouldn't publish anything about gay liberation meetings, Williams said, but the Daily Utah Chronicle, the student paper at the University of Utah, did write about them. Williams attended the meetings and took notes on everything he saw and heard.
Former Utah state Sen. Jim Dabakis, a longtime friend, said Williams "somehow ... seemed to understand that in 1976 that these meetings, marches and demonstrations were important. He documented who was where on what day, what they said. For hundreds of events ... his foresight in saving first-person narratives makes Utah unique in the Intermountain West."
The growth in Utah's LGBTQ+ activism stalled in the late 1970s, Williams said, after a series of violent murders of gay men, including social activist Anthony Adams, shut the community down and forced people to go into hiding.
How Utah's LGBTQ+ community evolved
Williams was one of the founders of the Gay and Lesbian Community Council of Utah, which started in 1986. He also was a frequent speaker on KRCL's "Concerning Gays and Lesbians" started by Donna Maldonado (who died in September).
But after Williams became a schoolteacher, he said, his involvement in the community was on the down low, because he would have lost his job otherwise.
Williams said he noticed then that the gay community was much like high school When the seniors graduate, the new students have no clue what went on before them.
"Their history, it's all gone. It's like everybody's always reinventing the wheel," he said.
That thought spurred Williams to become an archivist at the Utah Stonewall Center (which would eventually change its name to the Utah Pride Center), where he was also a founding member. He wanted to preserve and record as many things as possible, so he put his journal entries to use.(Ben Williams) The Utah Stonewall Center, founded in 1991 at 770 S. 300 West (where RubySnap, the cookie company, now resides), is seen here in an undated photograph. The Utah Stonewall Center later changed its name to the Utah Pride Center.
Williams said he wanted to write about the "nitty gritty," not just the big issues. "I didn't want people to think we were just these pure activists," he said.
Amongst his recordings, he was even a witness to the evolution of the LGBTQ initialism. Williams said it started as "gays and lesbians" until the first National Lesbian Conference took place in Atlanta in 1991, where bisexuality inclusion was introduced. Later on in 2010, it would add the "T" for transgendered people and "Q" for queer.
"At first it was GLBT," he said. "I have no idea why, but then LGBT became the standard."
Williams says he still calls it the gay community, even though he's aware it's not politically correct, "I call it the gay community, because to me, gay is still all-encompassing."
Because of the time he grew up in, Williams said, the issues the trans and gay communties face now are completely different to "older gay people" like him.
"Sexual identification or gender identity is almost driving the movement more than sexual orientation," he says. "To me, being gay was all about love, having the right to love who we fell in love with."
In the 1980s, Williams said, Utah was "beating us up over the heads saying we didn't deserve any rights because what we're doing was illegal." This was a decade after the American Psychiatric Association's 1973 decision to not categorize being gay as a psychological condition.
"Part of it is that I understand that things change and evolve and people have to build the community that they want to live. We built one we knew, we fought the good fight," Williams says. "We cannot bitch and moan because it's not the way it was. When we were young, we had to start from scratch, and now people don't have to start from scratch."
Williams cited the way BYU's LGBTQ student community has grown from the days he was a student there. "To be truly honest," he said, "it is so radically different to me that they even know that there's gay people down there. That [they] feel comfortable enough to challenge, because I didn't have that when I was there."(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Ben Williams says the internalized shame he faced as a gay man eventually inspired him to become an activist and the AIDS epidemic is what inspired him to come out at the age of 34. His activism has been recognized over the years as he keeps some memorabilia of his work. (Francisco Kjolseth/)
Here and now
Dabakis, responding via text, praised Williams' record keeping, and the impact it has had.
"After most of us are long forgotten, future historians [will] honor Ben's meticulous work in collecting and preserving the history of the LGBTQ community in Utah," Dabakis said. "Through the AIDS pandemic to marriage equality, Ben has been there every single day. Pen in hand."
Dabakis can't remember when or how he met Williams, just that he's been struck by his friend's ability to "come up with astonishing stories, using sources that would dazzle Sherlock Holmes."
Those efforts continue, because history is always being made. In 2022, Utah has seen Gov. Spencer Cox veto a bill regarding participation of transgender athletes in high school athletics (which the Utah Legislature overrode), and on the day Williams was interviewed The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints voice support for federal legislation to codify same-sex and interracial marriage.
Also this year, a Salt Lake City tea shop suffered online harassment after video of an all-ages drag show there went viral, and an HBO Max reality show drew angry responses when it shot an episode in which drag queens staged a show in a St. George public park.
"Part of history is going two feet forward and one foot back, but as long as you're going one foot forward, you're still making progress," Williams said. "Being old now, I can look over a span of history and see how things have progressed, that we are in a better place today than we were 50 years ago."
There will always be setbacks, Williams said, pointing to groups that would like to "eliminate us ... [and eliminate] women's rights, Black rights and immigration rights."
At the end of the day, Williams said, they aren't a "people if you don't have history."(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Ben Williams, a Utah LGBTQ historian who has seen the state's queer community develop from the 70s onward, has kept track of every meeting, moment and person crucial to that development in his journals. A founding member of the original Utah Stonewall Center, Williams can speak at length about the early queer scene, running a blog where he posts all the tidbits of history he's kept over the years.

2024 JAN 09 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at CDC & FDA Daily -- Current study results on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news reporting from Atlanta, Georgia, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, "Hispanic/Latino persons are disproportionately impacted by HIV in the US, and HIV diagnoses among Hispanic/Latino men in Georgia have increased over the past decade, particularly in metropolitan Atlanta. In 2022, the Georgia Department of Public Health detected five clusters of rapid HIV transmission centered among Hispanic/Latino gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (HLMSM) in metropolitan Atlanta." 
 Funders for this research include Cobb and Douglas Public Health, DeKalb County Board of Health, Rockdale County Health Department, Laila Woc-Colburn, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine. 
 The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "We conducted in-depth interviews with 65 service providers and 29 HLMSM to identify barriers and facilitators to HIV service access for HLMSM. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and translated, if needed. Initial data analyses were conducted rapidly in the field to inform public health actions. We then conducted additional analyses including line-by-line coding of the interview transcripts using a thematic analytic approach. We identified four main themes. First, inequity in language access was a predominant barrier. Second, multiple social and structural barriers existed. Third, HLMSM encountered intersectional stigma. Finally, the HLMSM community is characterized by its diversity, and there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to providing appropriate care to this population. The collection of qualitative data during an HIV cluster investigation allowed us to quickly identity barriers experienced by HLMSM when accessing HIV and other medical care, to optimize public health response and action." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "Well-designed program evaluation and implementation research may help elucidate specific strategies and tools to reduce health disparities, ensure equitable service access for HLMSM, and reduce HIV transmission in this population." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

The following information was released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):
September 22, 2022
Dear Colleague,
September 27 is National Gay Men's HIV/AIDS Awareness Day (NGMHAAD), a day to help end HIV stigma and encourage HIV testing, prevention, and treatment among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. As we celebrate the progress we have made in HIV prevention and treatment among gay and bisexual men, we must also acknowledge the challenges we still face. Racism, poverty, stigma, and homophobia serve as barriers to care and prevention, and continue to drive inequities that cause gay and bisexual menparticularly Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino mento be overrepresented in the HIV epidemic.
This NGMHAAD, we acknowledge the additional public health challenges and continued stigma that gay and bisexual men face. Although we are still learning about monkeypox amid the current outbreak, we are seeing similar patterns of inequity, with Hispanic/Latino and Black/African American gay and bisexual men representing the majority of people with monkeypox. Recently, CDC released a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report showing that people with HIV and with a recent history of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are disproportionately affected by monkeypox. This represents an important opportunity to use existing HIV and STD prevention and care models and resources to ensure equitable access to monkeypox information and services among gay and bisexual men, people with HIV, and people who experience increased incidence of STDs. Learn more about CDC's efforts to reduce stigma in monkeypox communication and community engagement.
Despite ongoing challenges, the efforts of public health and community advocates are making a difference in lowering new HIV infections among gay and bisexual men. From 2015 to 2019, the number of estimated new HIV infections among gay and bisexual men in the United States decreased from 26,900 to 24,500. Nonetheless, gay and bisexual men accounted for 70% of the total 34,800 estimated new HIV infections in the United States in 2019. Across the country, some communitiesspecifically Black/African American gay and bisexual men, and Hispanic/Latino gay and bisexual menare disproportionately affected by HIV. In 2019, Black/African American gay and bisexual men accounted for 26% and Hispanic/Latino gay and bisexual men accounted for 24% of estimated new HIV infections. As public health and community advocates, we must continue our work to address these racial and ethnic disparities.
One of the most effective tools we have to address ongoing challenges in HIV prevention is pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Unfortunately, not everyone who can benefit from PrEP has access to it. Current PrEP data reflect racial and regional disparities driven by structural challenges such as stigma, racism, and mistrust in the health care system. Among Black/African American people who could benefit from PrEP [PDF 2.5 MB], only 11% were prescribed PrEP in 2021, followed by 20% of Hispanic/Latino people and 80% of White people. In the South in 2020, only three states were at least halfway to the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. goal of 50% PrEP coverage by 2025.
CDC monitors HIV surveillance data to identify communities with rapid HIV transmission and implement tailored interventions that address these communities' needs. A new Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report analyzed data from 38 HIV clusters in 2018-2019 that had grown to more than 25 people by the end of 2021. Of those 38 clusters, 29 were primarily among gay and bisexual men, and these clusters also reflected racial and ethnic disparities.
The persistence of racial, ethnic, and regional HIV disparities reflects the effects of stigma, homophobia, racism, and discrimination that gay and bisexual men continue to face and shows us where we need to scale up treatment and prevention services. Identifying these gaps through cluster detection and response, a pillar of the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. initiative, allows CDC to deploy tailored interventions to those areas to improve health outcomes and reduce disparities and health inequities, a primary goal of the 2022-2025 National HIV/AIDS Strategy. Additionally, CDC continues to fund and support health departments and community-based organizations to develop and implement tailored HIV prevention programs for gay and bisexual men, including Black/African American gay and bisexual men and Hispanic/Latino gay and bisexual men.
As we work together toward ending the HIV epidemic, partners like you are essential at every step of the processfrom improving the reach of HIV prevention education, to reducing barriers to HIV prevention services like PrEP, and providing stigma-free care for people with HIV. Help us raise awareness about HIV testing, prevention, and treatment for gay and bisexual men by downloading and sharing resources from CDC's Let's Stop HIV Together campaign. If you are a health care provider, you can download HIV testing, prevention, and care materials to better serve gay and bisexual men. You can also share social media content from CDC's digital toolkit using the #NGMHAAD and #StopHIVTogether hashtags.
This NGMHAAD, as we continue to raise awareness about HIV and its disproportionate impact on gay and bisexual men, we encourage you to help address the current monkeypox outbreak. Learn more about monkeypox symptoms, transmission, prevention (including safer sex), and treatment, and share this information with your friends, families, communities, and colleagues. You can also download and share materials from our social media toolkit and communication resources page. As we learn more about monkeypox, we will continue updating our guidance for health departments and health care providers. Please check back regularly.
Together, we can build on the progress we have made and improve the quality of life and sexual health among gay and bisexual men, and all communities affected by HIV and monkeypox.

2023 OCT 09 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Health Policy and Law Daily -- A new study on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS is now available. According to news reporting originating from New York City, New York, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "This analysis of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey examined HIV syndemic factor associations (substance use, violence, mental health, and HIV risk behaviors) among adolescent gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men-a population with the highest prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infections. The representative sample (n = 644) exhibited low condom use (52%) and HIV testing (21%)." 
 Financial supporters for this research include D. R. Garcia served as the primary author of this article, and this work is based on his PhD dissertation in the Florence S. Downs PhD Program in Research and Theory Development at the New York University Meyers College of Nursing, under the mentorship of, New York University Meyers College of Nursing. 
 Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from New York University (NYU), "Adjusted multivariate logistic regression models showed that Blacks were less likely to report HIV testing (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.01-0.44], p< .01), whereas Hispanics were more likely to report four or more lifetime sexual partners (aOR = 3.75, 95% CI [1.49-9.44], p< .01), compared with Whites. A syndemic of substance use and intimate partner violence (sexual, sexual dating, and/or physical dating violence) was associated with early intercourse, multiple sexual partners, and drugs/alcohol before intercourse." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Multiple syndemic factor exposures were associated with additive risk, suggesting multilevel approaches for HIV prevention." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

2023 DEC 06 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx COVID-19 Daily -- Research findings on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting from London, United Kingdom, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, "This article examines the Instagram account @GaysoverCOVID which publicly exposed gay men who appeared to disregard COVID-related restrictions during the pandemic. While outwardly concerned to hold these men accountable, the article analyses posts and comments published on the platform to show how criticism focused on the appearance and perceived 'promiscuity' of the men exposed." 
 Financial supporters for this research include Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC), King's Together Fund, King's College London. 
 The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from King's College London, "The article draws on the work of Douglas Crimp (1989) to analyse this 'moralism' as a symptom of 'melancholia', a form of repressed mourning. It shows how the COVID pandemic has brought contested understandings of 'safer sex' to the surface, underpinning a set of anxieties concerning the loss of a 'responsible' gay subjecthood based on condom use. These anxieties were projected onto the figure of the 'circuit queen' in ways that reproduced long-standing discourses of 'slut-shaming." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "To leave this moralism behind, the author argues for greater attention to the affective dimensions of the transition from condom to PrEP-based HIV prevention." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

2023 OCT 27 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- New research on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS is the subject of a report. According to news reporting originating from Sydney, Australia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Using repeated behavioural surveillance data collected from gay and bisexual men (GBM) across Australia, we assessed trends in HIV prevention coverage (the level of 'safe sex' achieved in the population by the use of effective prevention methods, including condoms, pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] and having an undetectable viral load). We stratified these trends by age, country of birth/recency of arrival, sexual identity, and the proportion of gay residents in the participant's suburb." 
 Financial support for this research came from We acknowledge all the gay and bisexual men, including people living with HIV, who participated in the Gay Community Periodic Surveys, and the community organisations which make recruitment possible. We acknowledge the other members of the research team an. 
 Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the University of New South Wales Sydney, "Among 25,865 participants with casual male partners, HIV prevention coverage increased from 69.8% in 2017 to 75.2% in 2021, lower than the UNAIDS target of 95%. Higher levels of coverage were achieved among older GBM (= 45 years), non-recently-arrived migrants, and in suburbs with = 10% gay residents. The lowest levels of prevention coverage (and highest levels of HIV risk) were recorded among younger GBM (< 25 years) and bisexual and other-identified participants. Younger, recently-arrived, and bisexual GBM were the most likely to use condoms, while PrEP use was concentrated among gay men, 25-44-year-olds, and in suburbs with more gay residents. The use of undetectable viral load was most common among participants aged = 45 years. Our analysis shows that high HIV prevention coverage can be achieved through a mixture of condom use, PrEP use, and undetectable viral load, or by emphasising PrEP use. In the Australian context, younger, bisexual and other-identified GBM should be prioritised for enhanced access to effective HIV prevention methods." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "We encourage other jurisdictions to assess the level of coverage achieved by combination prevention, and variations in uptake." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

2023 JUL 27 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Researchers detail new data in HIV/AIDS. According to news originating from Toronto, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Half of new HIV infections in Thailand are among young people, the majority of whom are young gay and other men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTGW)." 
 Financial supporters for this research include Social Sciences And Humanities Research Council of Canada; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Canada Foundation For Innovation. 
 Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Toronto: "Amid low pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) coverage, we explored practice-based factors that impact PrEP engagement among YMSM and YTGW. In 2018, we conducted 4 focus group discussions with 20 YMSM and 5 YTGW, and 22 in-depth interviews (5 in 2022) with healthcare providers (HCPs), community-based organization (CBO)/nongovernmental organization (NGO) staff, and peer educators. The inclusion of PrEP in universal healthcare coverage, including YMSM and YTGW, is a substantial facilitator of PrEP use; however, systemic barriers at microsocial (lack of communication about PrEP from HCPs, teachers, parents), mesosocial (healthcare-service fragmentation, lack of PrEP-competent HCPs), and macrosocial levels (annual quotas on free HIV-testing, HIV- and sexual-stigma) constrain and disincentivize adolescents' engagement with PrEP." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "National scale-up of youth-friendly and LGBT-affirmative CBO/NGO clinics, HCP training, and tailored programs to support adolescents' adherence may promote PrEP engagement among YMSM and YTGW in Thailand."

2023 NOV 21 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Current study results on HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news reporting out of Rochester, New York, by NewsRx editors, research stated, "Research has begun to examine human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention strategies within the Ghanaian context. Still, little is known about specific populations such as gay, bisexual, and other cisgender men who have sex with men (GBMSM) living in slum communities." 
 Financial supporters for this research include Yale University Flags Grant. 
 Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Department of Public Health Sciences: "We studied HIV prevention strategies such as condoms and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in slum communities and the awareness and willingness to use these choices among GBMSM. This qualitative study examines HIV prevention strategies, specifically examining PrEP and condom use behaviors among GBMSM in Ghana. We conducted in-depth face-to-face interviews among 12 GBMSM from slums in Accra and Kumasi cities in Ghana. Data were analyzed through a summative content analysis with multiple reviewers to develop codes. Data were collected from participants in January 2022. We found the fear and perceived risk of infection were motivators for consistent condom use, especially during anal sex. GBMSM living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy were more inclined to use condoms. We found motivations for using PrEP were influenced by the type of sexual activity and a history of negative HIV status. Also, the barriers to PrEP for GBMSM included limited access to healthcare facilities and the distance to these facilities." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "To improve condom and PrEP access and uptake, we recommend addressing structural barriers by increasing the number of health facilities and implementing targeted interventions to address the lack of information on HIV awareness and prevention. Involving peer educators may also effectively promote HIV prevention strategies, especially in communities with limited access to healthcare such as slums. Overcoming these access constraints could significantly enhance awareness and prevention of HIV, leading to improved health outcomes for GBMSM living in slum communities."

2023 DEC 25 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- New study results on HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news originating from Madrid, Spain, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Sexualized drug use (SDU) has become a public health concern in recent years. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of SDU in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men living with HIV (HIV + GBMSM) in Madrid during 2019/2020 and compare it with data from 2016/2017 in order to detect changes in patterns." 
 Funders for this research include Gilead Science. 
 The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Infanta Leonor University Hospital: "We analyzed the frequency of SDU in a sample of HIV + GBMSM attending HIV clinics, who participated in an anonymous online survey regarding sexual behavior and recreational drug use. The association between SDU, sexual risk behaviors, and STIs was evaluated. This study included 424 HIV + GBMSM, with a mean age of 40 (10.43) years. Overall, 94% (396) reported being sexually active. Additionally, 33% (140) had been diagnosed with an STI within the previous year. Moreover, 54% (229) had used drugs in the last year, 25% (107) engaged in SDU, and 16% (17) reported engagement in slamsex. After adjusting for confounding factors, SDU was associated with STIs, fisting, unprotected anal intercourse, and having >24 sexual partners in the last year. According to the DUDIT test scores, 80% (81) probably had problematic drug use ( 6 points), and 8% (8) probable drug dependence ( 25 points). When comparing the U-SEX-1 (2016/2017) data with the U-SEX-2 (2019/2020) data, no significant differences were found in the proportion of participants practicing SDU or slamming." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "The prevalence of SDU among HIV + GBMSM has remained high in recent years and without significant changes. The risk of problematic drug use among those who practice SDU is high. We observed a clear association between SDU, high-risk sexual behaviors, and STIs."

2023 SEP 29 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Current study results on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news originating from Ann Arbor, Michigan, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "HIV in the USA disproportionately affects Black young gay and bisexual men (Y-GBM). This article presents outcomes of a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing Mobilizing our Voices for Empowerment (MOVE), a culturally and developmentally tailored critical consciousness-based intervention for Black Y-GBM living with HIV (ages 16-24), with a comparison health promotion intervention." 
 Financial supporters for this research include NIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD), NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), NIH National Institute on Minority Health & Health Disparities (NIMHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA. 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Michigan, "Black Y-GBM (n = 54) from four cities participated. Mixed effects models across four assessment points revealed participants in MOVE showed greater increases over time in perceived stress of HIV disclosure, self-efficacy for limiting HIV risk behavior, and condom use self-efficacy. Examining mean difference scores separately, participants in MOVE demonstrated increases in self-efficacy for HIV disclosure, perceived policy control, and self-efficacy for limiting HIV risk behavior Immediately post-intervention, MOVE participants reported greater decreases in condomless intercourse with negative/unknown partners." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "MOVE may have potential to improve the health of Black Y-GBM living with HIV and reduce further transmission." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

Larry Kramer, a New York playwright whose theatrical - often confrontational - tactics forced a nation to push aside its apathy and homophobia to confront the Aids crisis, has died. He was 84.
Kramer succumbed to pneumonia, his husband, David Webster, told The New York Times.
Kramer was diagnosed with HIV, the virus that causes Aids, more than 30 years ago when it was still considered a likely death sentence. Yet Kramer lived to see not only effective Aids therapies but the legalisation of gay marriage - another cause for which he had long battled - the production of several plays and the recent dawn of a new viral pandemic, coronavirus.
Kramer's sense of urgency about the Aids crisis was articulated in a pathbreaking 1983 essay, 1,112 and Counting. "Our continued existence as gay men upon the face of this earth is at stake," he wrote. "Unless we fight for our lives, we shall die."
As an artist and an activist he was known for an unyielding approach that generated attention and controversy. One of the groups he founded, Aids Coalition to Unleash Power - or Act Up - shut down the New York Stock Exchange, picketed the Food and Drug Administration and wrapped the house of Jesse Helms, the conservative US senator, in a mammoth condom.
One of its targets was Anthony Fauci, the longtime head of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, who is now leading the nation's fight against coronavirus. Years ago, Kramer berated Dr Fauci as an incompetent and a murderer for what he believed was a plodding and bureaucratic response to the Aids crisis.
Dr Fauci eventually came to sympathise with Kramer, and shifted his agency's approach to speed up testing of experimental drugs and give affected communities more say in their treatment. He even described his bitter antagonist as a friend. "In American medicine, there are two eras. Before Larry and after Larry," Fauci told The New Yorker in 2002. "There is no question in my mind that Larry helped change medicine in this country. And he helped change it for the better. When all the screaming and the histrionics are forgotten, that will remain."
Kramer was born in Connecticut in 1935 and grew up in the Washington area. While a student at Yale University in the early 1950s he attempted suicide, an act he attributed to the alienation he felt because of his sexuality.
After graduation he worked for a talent agency in New York, then Columbia Studios, which sent him to London. His biggest film success was Women in Love in 1969, which he adapted from the DH Lawrence novel.
Kramer's activism career was born when he gathered with friends in his New York City apartment in 1981 to discuss a new illness that was ravaging the community. That meeting spawned the Gay Men's Health Crisis advocacy group.
"The very first people who got infected and died were my friends, my age group, from New York and Fire Island," Kramer told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2017. "So, from the very beginning I got involved."
But he fell out with the group a year later after clashing with fellow members and went on to launch the more combative Act Up, whose motto was Silence = Death.
It was a pattern that was not uncommon for a tenacious man who could be a brutal critic. In a recent interview with the Boston Globe, he referred to the National Institutes of Health as "a cesspool of mediocrity" and his friend Dr Fauci as the "consummate manipulative bureaucrat". (He was an equal-opportunity offender, becoming a pariah in the gay community for a satirical 1978 novel, Faggots, that lambasted what he saw as its hedonism).
Kramer's best-known play, The Normal Heart, debuted in 1985 and told the largely autobiographical story of a New York writer's fury as Aids strikes down his lover and friends in the early 1980s while public health and elected officials turn away. A 2011 production on Broadway won three Tony awards.
His most recent work was a sprawling, 1,600-page alternative history of America. It included the line, "Show me a plague and I'll show you the world!" Kramer, at times, seemed exhausted by the burden of his activism.
In a 2017 interview with The New York Times, a frail Kramer lamented that the Aids crisis was still ongoing - as was his fight for equality and social justice. "I don't think that things are better generally," he said. "We have people running this government who hate us, and have said they hate us. The fight's never over." Joshua Chaffin

Gay Men's Health Crisis issued the following news release:
United by a common cause and undaunted by the COVID-19 pandemic, AIDS Walk San Francisco and AIDS Walk New York announced their first-ever collaboration: AIDS Walk: Live at Home, a 90-minute, livestreamed virtual event on Sunday, July 19 to raise money that benefits San Francisco's PRC and New York's GMHC: two nonprofit organizations providing vital services for people affected by HIV/AIDS, COVID-19 and other challenges. Those looking to participate may register for free and raise funds or donate directly at aidswalk.net.
AIDS Walk: Live at Home will feature performances and appearances by a broad list of talent, including: award-winning icon, Bette Midler; Grammy-winning global superstar, Gloria Estefan; Golden Globe winner, Matt Bomer; entertainment icon, Vanessa Williams; Emmy and Golden Globe Award winner, Laura Linney; Tony Award winner, Alan Cumming; Skylar Astin (Zoe's Extraordinary Playlist); Tan France (Queer Eye); Bobby Berk (Queer Eye); Karamo Brown (Queer Eye); Peter Gallagher (Grace and Frankie, Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist); Ross Mathews (RuPaul's Drag Race); Alex Newell (Zoe's Extraordinary Playlist); Elvis Duran (iHeartMedia on-air personality); Mae Whitman (Good Girls); and stars from RuPaul's Drag Race, including Nina West, Jackie Cox, Latrice Royale, Willam, Chi Chi DeVayne, Alexis Michelle, The Vixen and Ginger Minj.
In addition to being live-streamed on aidswalk.net, PRCSF.org and GMHC.org, AIDS Walk: Live at Home also will be broadcast on ABC7/KGO-TV in San Francisco. Presented in partnership with iHeartMedia, the event will feature iHeartMedia on-air personality, Elvis Duran and will be streamed live on iHeartRadio's YouTube channel. Additionally, iHeart's Z100 in New York and KIOI, KMEL and KYLD in San Francisco will support the event with multiple radio promotions in the days and weeks leading up to July 19.
Featuring voices from both cities, AIDS Walk: Live at Home will harness the strength and individual character of two landmark events and the communities that embrace them year after year.
"From the Bronx to the Bay Area, this creative joint effort will unite our distinct yet like-minded communities of supporters from across multiple regions. At the same time, supporters from other locations across the country - particularly with cities that do not have their own AIDS Walks - will be able to join in on the fun," said Brett Andrews, CEO of PRC, Kelsey Louie, CEO of GMHC and Craig R. Miller, founder of both events in a joint statement.
New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo issued this statement of support: "GMHC's staff and volunteers are doing heroic work in the midst of the pandemic-delivering life-saving services to thousands of people threatened by both HIV and COVID-19. This critical organization needs our support and I encourage all New Yorkers to participate in this year's virtual AIDS Walk."
"Stemming from the uncertainty surrounding the current healthcare crisis, we collectively decided to bring teams together virtually to create a new vision for the Bay Area's largest, single-day AIDS-related fundraiser," said Andrews. "Now marking our 33rd year, we're really excited about AIDS Walk: Live at Home which will raise awareness and funds that support HIV care and prevention services, as well as mental health, substance use, housing and other important social programs."
"When the COVID-19 pandemic struck New York City, we moved quickly to adapt our services to meet head on the new environment and its challenges for people living with HIV," said Louie. "With people sheltering at home, we are bringing GMHC's services directly to the doorsteps of thousands. We've delivered more than 30,000 meals thus far. We are meeting the skyrocketing need for mental health services and legal services, substance use counseling, and HIV home testing. Videoconferencing and other technologies have been harnessed to provide help with supportive housing, financial management, and so much more, so that our clients' vital resources continue uninterrupted."
"For those of us who were part of the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the plight of our country right now is at once unprecedented and strangely familiar," said Miller. "Over the past 34 years, we have always stood, walked and marched with all who oppose police brutality and the racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic disparities that persist in the criminal justice and healthcare systems of America. Protecting people who have been singled out, harassed, scapegoated and underserved is what we do. It is our legacy and it remains our commitment."

2023 OCT 26 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- New research on HIV/AIDS is the subject of a new report. According to news reporting out of Sydney, Australia, by NewsRx editors, research stated, "Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) are overrepresented in diagnoses of sexually transmitted infections (STI) relative to their population size. This study assessed trends in STI testing and diagnoses among GBM in Australia." 
 The news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of New South Wales Sydney: "The Gay Community Periodic Surveys are repeated cross-sectional behavioural surveillance surveys of GBM. Participants reported the number of anal swabs, throat swabs, urine samples, and blood tests for syphilis they undertook in the last year. ‘Frequent comprehensive testing' was defined as 3 of each test in the previous year. Participants reported STI diagnoses of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and other STIs in the last year. Trends in testing and diagnoses from 2017-2020 and 2020-2021 were assessed with logistic regression models. We analysed 24,488 survey responses from participants reporting casual sex in the last 6 months. Between 2017-2020, frequent comprehensive STI testing decreased among HIV-negative GBM on PrEP from 71.7% to 68.9% and declined further to 58.6% in 2021. Frequent comprehensive STI testing was stable during 2017-2020 among HIV-negative/untested GBM not on PrEP (17.4% to 14.6%) and HIV-positive GBM (30.4% to 35.1%) but declined in 2021 to 7.5% among non-PrEP-users and 25.7% among HIV-positive participants. There were minimal changes in STI diagnoses during 2017-2020, but diagnoses declined in 2021." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Many GBM do not meet Australian STI testing guidelines that recommend quarterly testing. Further evaluation of whether this recommendation is realistic or necessary to reduce STIs among GBM is recommended."

Review: William Yang's Sydneyphiles Reimagined, State Library of New South Wales.We are all photographers now, since the advent of smartphones and the selfie. So it may seem strange to be writing a review of an exhibition of photographs when, in their digital form, they are both ubiquitous and at the same time largely redundant.

Alternative Sydney up closeWilliam Yang (pronounced Young but he says he doesn't care anymore) is 80 this year. He has seen the alternative cultures of Sydney up close, in a way few people alive have.
He never goes far without his cameras, shooting social events over the past 50 years for the social pages of newspapers and fashion magazines.

Linda Jackson, 1976. William Yang Yang has an extensive visual record of Sydney cultural life, beginning with his first ever exhibition of photographs, Sydneyphiles. Sydneyphiles was shown at the then ACP gallery in Oxford Street, Paddington in 1977, documenting the mainstream Sydney social scene and the then illegal gay party scene in the years since his arrival in Sydney in 1969.
It is a priceless resource, as the State Library of NSW has recognised having purchased the collection. It has now been remounted in its entirety as a part of Sydney World Pride 2023. Pride's theme, Mana Nangamai Djuralli, means"Gather, Dream, Amplify" in Gadigal language. It is an especially apt theme for this exhibition.
Portraits and private partiesMore than 200 images, mostly portraits, are on display: celebrities such as Brett Whiteley, Kate Fitzpatrick, Jackie Weaver, Penelope Seidler, Robyn Nevin among many others alongside candid shots with titles such as"Men Fucking" and"Gary Injecting Junk".

Sleeping men. William Yang Others with captions such as"Untitled no 1 (men sleeping)" reveal two naked young men spooning in post-coital slumber in the basement of a house party. Another image"doris fish with man in bondage gear" shows the eponymous drag queen Doris performing fellatio on the man - viewers get much more than the label suggests.
Many are shots taken at private parties such as those held by madame lash in her warehouse. These pictures feature guests tied to a rack surrounded by crowds of party-goers. It is a part of Sydney's recent cultural history that few people still alive have witnessed.

Madam Lash's rack party, 1977. William Yang Many of Yang's subjects were lost to the AIDS epidemic, powerfully captured in his photographs and performances in unforgettably moving works such as Sadness and Friends of Dorothy. That's what makes this an important exhibition for Sydney in this year of World Pride.
Gay liberationYang's work also features in the party currently at UNSW Galleries, another significant exhibition of Sydney gay visual culture for Sydney World Pride.
This covers the years beginning with the inaugural Mardi Gras in 1978, a protest march for gay rights that became infamous for the brutality of the nsw police , to now.
The changes could not be more stark. Mardi Gras is now and has been for some time (for those living under a rock) a celebration and affirmation of LGBTQI culture and identity with the NSW Police participating.
Yang refers to these as the years of"gay liberation" and is justly proud of his role in recording this extraordinary transition of gay life from illegality to recognition and celebration.

Review: William Yang's Sydneyphiles Reimagined, State Library of New South Wales.
We are all photographers now, since the advent of smartphones and the selfie. So it may seem strange to be writing a review of an exhibition of photographs when, in their digital form, they are both ubiquitous and at the same time largely redundant.
William Yang's photographs in Sydneyphiles offer the complete opposite of the selfie. Instead of the throwaway image, he offers carefully framed and curated portraits. 
In his famous slideshow performances, he narrates the events behind the pictures and names the subjects so they are not forgotten or discarded.

NEW YORK - LGBT New Yorkers who lived through the AIDS crisis of the 1980s see some bleak parallels in the COVID-19 pandemic now wracking their city. But more so, they stress the differences.
Now, they share the same plight as their fellow citizens while the federal government is pledging trillions of dollars to combat the pandemic. Back then they were frighteningly marginalized in the face of indifference from government leaders and much of the public.
"There was a lot of fear and a lot of anger," said Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York City psychiatrist. "Fear because nobody knew what the cause was, anger because of the lack of concerted response."
Drescher was doing his internship and residency at New York hospitals in the early '80s as doctors struggled to learn the cause of AIDS. Effective treatment didn't emerge until 1995.
"In that time, many died, including many of my professional colleagues, patients and friends," Drescher recalled. "My partner and I would sit down every once in a while and ask, 'Who have we lost?'"
According to the city health department, more than 62,000 people died of AIDS in New York between 1981 and 1995. COVID-19 has killed more than 6,300 in the city in just four weeks
Perry Halkitis, dean of the Rutgers School of Public Health and a specialist in HIV/AIDS prevention, was a student at Columbia University and Hunter College in New York during the '80s. "I was petrified," he recalls.
Halkitis says he and other gay survivors of that epoch carry permanent emotional scars. He finds it traumatic to see some similarities in the COVID-19 outbreak.
"There's the same anxiety and powerlessness and helplessness that was very present in the '80s," he said. "And this virus could kill a person in 10 days, instead of years."
Yet he also notes that HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was far deadlier in its early years than the coronavirus. It was viewed for a time as a terminal disease compared to a projected 1% to 3% overall mortality rate for COVID-19 in the U.S.
Andy Humm, 66, co-host of the weekly TV news hour Gay USA, was among several dozen gay men summoned by activist Larry Kramer to a meeting in August 1981, shortly after the first news reports of a mysterious disease that was killing gays. They heard a doctor "softly and terrifyingly tell us what was going on," Humm said.
Kramer and a few colleagues soon founded Gay Men's Health Crisis, the first non-profit in New York focused on serving people with AIDS.
"I remember one GHMC meeting - the guys would break down, crying for the friends and the way of life they were losing," Humm said. "It was chilling."
He recalls the first major TV news broadcast showing men wasting away from AIDS.
"People gasped. These were good-looking guys who now looked like the Phantom of the Opera," Humm said. "Two guys in my building tied themselves together and jumped out the window."
Among the co-founders of Gay Men's Health Crisis was Dr. Lawrence Mass, who in May 1981 wrote the first news article about AIDS.
"There was confusion, chaos, a lot of denial," he said. "We didn't even know what we were dealing with. With homophobia so overt, we wondered if it might be some kind of plot."
Now 73, Mass still practices in New York, specializing in addiction medicine. He recalls that some gay men, in the 1980s, continued engaging in promiscuous sex even as risks became more apparent.
AIDS was not an equal-opportunity disease in its early years. Overwhelmingly, its victims were gay men, intravenous drug users, Haitians and hemophiliacs. Gay activists believe that the marginalized status of those victims made it easy for President Ronald Reagan's administration - and to some extent New York City's government - to dismiss the seriousness of the crisis.
"AIDS was seen as God's plague and as our just desserts for a hedonistic lifestyle," says James Esseks, a New Yorker since 1987 who heads the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT & HIV Project. "Most of the nation simply looked the other way."
COVID-19, by contrast, strikes virtually every demographic group, although some LGBT activists say their community may suffer disproportionately because of higher rates of HIV and cancer, and discrimination in some health care settings.
Peter Staley, a long-time AIDS/HIV activist in New York, said the Trump administration's initial response to the coronavirus outbreak enraged him, reminding him of the Reagan administration's indifference early in the AIDS crisis
"Over the next nine months, we're all going to know people who will die," Staley said. "We're going to have, compacted into nine months, what we went through over 15 years in New York City."
"At least we could go to funerals back then, and hug each other through all that pain," he said. "We're not going to have that this time. We can't gather in person to celebrate the lives of those we've lost."
Among the thousands of New Yorkers killed by AIDS were a huge number of highly talented and creative gay men - artists, musicians, designers and others.
COVID-19 deaths are less focused, though the LGBT community has suffered notable losses. They include playwright Terrence McNally, transgender activist Lorena Borjas and lawyer Richard E. Weber, Jr., 57, a longtime board member of the LGBT Bar Association of Greater New York who managed its free legal clinic.
The association's executive director, Eric Lesh, was a grade-schooler in Florida as the AIDS crisis unfolded, He's been in New York nearly 20 years and knows many survivors of that epidemic.
Lesh, 42, who along with his husband weathered a bout of COVID-19, was shocked by Weber's death.
"Richard would have watched lots of his friends pass away in the AIDS crisis," Lesh said. "And then to be swept up in another pandemic -- it just feels so sad."

Province apologizes for gay pair in HIV/AIDS post

Advocates say a social media post by the Saskatchewan government that was pulled within hours perpetuates a long-held - and damaging - perception about HIV and AIDS.
The picture, which was shared across social media platforms on Tuesday to mark World AIDS Day, showed two men beneath the heading: "HIV is on the rise in Saskatchewan." By Wednesday morning, the image had been removed and the province had issued an apology.
Health Minister Paul Merriman apologized to "everyone in the community" for the "disappointing" post and said a deputy minister would look into how it came to be published. "I don't think it portrays everyone who is fighting HIV/AIDS," Merriman said.
Critics went a step farther, arguing the image furthers a myth that HIV/AIDS only affects members of the gay community.
"In all honesty, the government's post only services to further stigmatize the gay and queer community at a time when HIV is preventable and treatable," said OUTSaskatoon interim executive co-director Jack Saddleback.
"HIV is different nowadays. It's not the 1980s. We are 2020, and HIV does not discriminate based on your romantic and sexual orientation."
Opposition Leader Ryan Meili called the message homophobic.
Saskatoon Sexual Health executive director Heather Hale said the image doesn't represent the reality of HIV in Saskatchewan.
"For a time, HIV was seen as an infection that was spread, passed on or afflicted upon the queer community. And we know in Saskatchewan that HIV looks different than that, and that the face of HIV reflects our community," Hale said.
The province's HIV rate is twice the national average.
A decade of government data shows intravenous drug use is by far the leading cause of new infections. The second is sex between heterosexual partners.
"I think it's telling that was their only message," said Jason Mercredi, executive director of Prairie Harm Reduction - an organization known until earlier this year as AIDS Saskatoon.
"It goes to show HIV hasn't been given the attention it needs."
Mercredi said the gaffe has created an opportunity to have a frank conversation about what Saskatchewan people should know about HIV.
"At least now people are talking about it," he said, encouraging people to learn about the role sharing drug equipment plays in spreading HIV.
Hale said good health messaging should be rooted in an idea of "nothing about us, without us."
"Health promotion is complicated. It's a hard job," she said.
"But at SSH, we really try to show the complexity of the situation while also leaving the viewer feeling they have the power to make choices."
Merriman said the government continues to fund measures to prevent the spread of HIV.
Preliminary data show 118 new cases were identified in 2020 as of Sept. 24.

Larry Kramer, a New York playwright whose theatrical - often confrontational - tactics forced a nation to push aside its apathy and homophobia to confront the Aids crisis, has died. He was 84.
Kramer succumbed to pneumonia, his husband, David Webster, told The New York Times.
Kramer was diagnosed with HIV, the virus that causes Aids, more than 30 years ago when it was still considered a likely death sentence. Yet Kramer lived to see not only effective Aids therapies but the legalisation of gay marriage - another cause for which he had long battled - the production of several plays and the recent dawn of a new viral pandemic, coronavirus.
Kramer's sense of urgency about the Aids crisis was articulated in a pathbreaking 1983 essay, 1,112 and Counting. "Our continued existence as gay men upon the face of this earth is at stake," he wrote. "Unless we fight for our lives, we shall die."
As an artist and an activist he was known for an unyielding approach that generated attention and controversy. One of the groups he founded, Aids Coalition to Unleash Power - or Act Up - shut down the New York Stock Exchange, picketed the Food and Drug Administration and wrapped the house of Jesse Helms, the conservative US senator, in a mammoth condom.
One of its targets was Anthony Fauci, the longtime head of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, who is now leading the nation's fight against coronavirus. Years ago, Kramer berated Dr Fauci as an incompetent and a murderer for what he believed was a plodding and bureaucratic response to the Aids crisis.
Dr Fauci eventually came to sympathise with Kramer, and shifted his agency's approach to speed up testing of experimental drugs and give affected communities more say in their treatment. He even described his bitter antagonist as a friend. "In American medicine, there are two eras. Before Larry and after Larry," Fauci told The New Yorker in 2002. "There is no question in my mind that Larry helped change medicine in this country. And he helped change it for the better. When all the screaming and the histrionics are forgotten, that will remain."
Kramer was born in Connecticut in 1935 and grew up in the Washington area. While a student at Yale University in the early 1950s he attempted suicide, an act he attributed to the alienation he felt because of his sexuality.
After graduation he worked for a talent agency in New York, then Columbia Studios, which sent him to London. His biggest film success was Women in Love in 1969, which he adapted from the DH Lawrence novel.
Kramer's activism career was born when he gathered with friends in his New York City apartment in 1981 to discuss a new illness that was ravaging the community. That meeting spawned the Gay Men's Health Crisis advocacy group.
"The very first people who got infected and died were my friends, my age group, from New York and Fire Island," Kramer told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2017. "So, from the very beginning I got involved."
But he fell out with the group a year later after clashing with fellow members and went on to launch the more combative Act Up, whose motto was Silence = Death.
It was a pattern that was not uncommon for a tenacious man who could be a brutal critic. In a recent interview with the Boston Globe, he referred to the National Institutes of Health as "a cesspool of mediocrity" and his friend Dr Fauci as the "consummate manipulative bureaucrat". (He was an equal-opportunity offender, becoming a pariah in the gay community for a satirical 1978 novel, Faggots, that lambasted what he saw as its hedonism).
Kramer's best-known play, The Normal Heart, debuted in 1985 and told the largely autobiographical story of a New York writer's fury as Aids strikes down his lover and friends in the early 1980s while public health and elected officials turn away. A 2011 production on Broadway won three Tony awards.
His most recent work was a sprawling, 1,600-page alternative history of America. It included the line, "Show me a plague and I'll show you the world!" Kramer, at times, seemed exhausted by the burden of his activism.
In a 2017 interview with The New York Times, a frail Kramer lamented that the Aids crisis was still ongoing - as was his fight for equality and social justice. "I don't think that things are better generally," he said. "We have people running this government who hate us, and have said they hate us. The fight's never over." Joshua Chaffin

When the Aids epidemic hit New York in the early 1980s, Bernárd Lynch did all he could to care for the sick and dying. The Ennisborn priest founded the first ministry for people with Aids in the city, supporting countless gay men who had been shunned by their families. He saw many of his friends succumb to the condition. Nobody knew the cause back then, and there was no treatment.
Lynch will never forget the terror of those early crisis years. "We used to go to patients in hospital and find their food had been left outside the door for days because staff were so afraid of contracting Aids. When you visited people, you dressed up like you were going on a moonwalk - covered from head to toe."
The ministry's work was often more practical than spiritual. "I spent more time shopping, changing diapers and cleaning up urine than giving the last rites or praying with the sick," Lynch says.
He had appealed for volunteers at St Francis Xavier Church in Greenwich Village after becoming overwhelmed with requests for help. The ministry grew to more than 1,000 members, but about half of them had died within a few years. Many were abandoned by their families when it was discovered they had Aids, while fellow priests who became ill were excluded by their diocese and religious communities.
Yet there were also moments of great tenderness. "I picked up one Irish mother at JFK whose son was in hospital. 'How's Michael?' she asked, and I had to tell her he was quite ill. 'He has the Rock Hudson disease,' she said [referring to the actor who died of the condition in 1985], and I said, 'Yes, he does'."
"She found out he was gay about two weeks before he died, but she was formidable. I took the funeral and asked her if she'd like to say a few words. She went up to the altar in front of around 200 people - a woman who had never spoken in public before - and said: 'Thank you. You were his real family.' It was inspirational to see at a time when so many others had rejected their sons on their deathbeds."
Lynch is talking to the Independent after donating his personal papers to the National Library of Ireland. The Fr Bernárd Lynch Archive includes records of smear campaigns against him, personal letters to his family while he was coming out as a gay man, and letters from people struggling to reconcile their sexuality with church teaching.
What impact did his time in New York have on him? "Well, I was radicalised. I was devastated, but I had no time to cry - and no time to recover. Day after day, you were in and out of funeral homes and hospitals visiting the sick. And, of course, we all thought we had it. I went home in 1982 to tell my family about what was happening and to make a will for the first time in my life, because I genuinely thought my number was up."
Lynch has struggled with his faith in the years since, but he stops short of describing himself as a nonbeliever. "Maybe I'm a coward, but I couldn't have kept going if I didn't hold on to something. Even today, it's a hope more than a belief."
There were no such doubts growing up in 1950s Ireland. Mass at Ennis cathedral was, he says, like Broadway. "It was our theatre, to put it in secular terms. With the pre-Vatican II church, everything was in Latin and everything felt very dramatic. Men and boys went around in the fanciest of clothes, and I just found it extraordinary."
But he also came to appreciate the spiritual aspects of religion. "I had an interest in things that were unexplainable, and things other than what we perceive. You know, the beauty of creation and all that."
DISILLUSIONED After seminary training and a stint in Zambia, Lynch was sent to New York in 1975 to pursue graduate studies. It was here that he finally came to terms with his sexuality.
He contacted Dignity, a Catholic LGBT group, but was nervous about getting involved.
"When I first joined, I didn't tell anyone I was a priest or even give my second name," he says. He only became more disillusioned with Catholic authorities when the Aids crisis took hold. Church leaders expressed little sympathy with the dying, and a Vatican spokesman went as far as to suggest Aids was a punishment for immoral behaviour.
At the height of the epidemic, the Archdiocese of New York opposed legislation banning discrimination against gay people in employment and housing.
"People with Aids were being fired and thrown out of their homes," Lynch recalls. "Cardinal John O'Connor of New York did everything in his power to stop that legislation and was succeeding. Council members were told they wouldn't get the Catholic vote if they voted for the bill. People said to me that if I testified in favour, as a priest, a lot of these Catholic members would take courage. I went to City Hall and testified, and it did finally pass - although not for that reason alone."
The Archdiocese of New York refused to renew his licence to minister as a priest. He approached other bishops but was shut out. It was, he says, the end of his career in America.
In 1992, Lynch left for London, where he worked with an Aids counselling group. Treatment has improved since then, but he is conscious that stigma endures. "There are families [in Ireland] I can't visit even today because it might draw attention," he says. "The fear is that I'll be recognised in their locality, and then the secret will be out.'" It was in London that Lynch met his now husband, fellow Irishman Billy Desmond. In 2006, he became - it's believed - the first Catholic priest to enter a civil partnership. The couple held their wedding in Co Clare in 2017, two years after the passing of the marriage equality referendum.
"To be able to come back and marry in my own home county was such a gift," he says. "You know, we left home because we couldn't stay, but there are people who stayed and have now given us a country to come home to. I really am so proud of Ireland."
Lynch has been a prominent activist, meeting such figures as President Mary Robinson and Elton John. He remains deeply troubled by the church's position on LGBT issues. As founder of a support group for gay clergy in London, he has met countless priests torn between their jobs and sexuality. "Things might be a bit softer under Pope Francis, but the teaching is still that we're disordered in our nature and evil in our love. It's a toxic teaching that does such damage to people. The church still won't come out and say loud and clear that that teaching is wrong and that gay people are as much loved by God and accepted as straight people."
Katherine McSharry, acting director of the National Library, describes the donation of Lynch's archive as an important addition to its collections. His papers provide insights into "important questions in our national life, including the nature of faith and organised religion, the taboos around sexuality and individual expression, and the impact the Aids crisis had on the LGBTI+ community", she says.
There will be an event on Monday to mark the acquisition of the archive, after which it will be available for public consultation. Libraries in the US and UK had also expressed interest, but Lynch is pleased his papers have ended up in Dublin. "What this is doing, as I understand it, is bringing the diaspora home," he says. "There were so many who left and then couldn't come back when they were ill; who never saw their families again. All those nameless Irish people in the archive, who can't be named even today, are in a sense now coming home. It's about them, not me."

Larry Kramer, a New York playwright whose theatrical - often confrontational - tactics forced a nation to push aside its apathy and homophobia to confront the Aids crisis, has died. He was 84.
Kramer succumbed to pneumonia, his husband, David Webster, told The New York Times.
Kramer was diagnosed with HIV, the virus that causes Aids, more than 30 years ago when it was still considered a likely death sentence. Yet Kramer lived to see not only effective Aids therapies but the legalisation of gay marriage - another cause for which he had long battled - the production of several plays and the recent dawn of a new viral pandemic, coronavirus.
Kramer's sense of urgency about the Aids crisis was articulated in a pathbreaking 1983 essay, 1,112 and Counting. "Our continued existence as gay men upon the face of this earth is at stake," he wrote. "Unless we fight for our lives, we shall die."
As an artist and an activist he was known for an unyielding approach that generated attention and controversy. One of the groups he founded, Aids Coalition to Unleash Power - or Act Up - shut down the New York Stock Exchange, picketed the Food and Drug Administration and wrapped the house of Jesse Helms, the conservative US senator, in a mammoth condom.
One of its targets was Anthony Fauci, the longtime head of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, who is now leading the nation's fight against coronavirus. Years ago, Kramer berated Dr Fauci as an incompetent and a murderer for what he believed was a plodding and bureaucratic response to the Aids crisis.
Dr Fauci eventually came to sympathise with Kramer, and shifted his agency's approach to speed up testing of experimental drugs and give affected communities more say in their treatment. He even described his bitter antagonist as a friend. "In American medicine, there are two eras. Before Larry and after Larry," Fauci told The New Yorker in 2002. "There is no question in my mind that Larry helped change medicine in this country. And he helped change it for the better. When all the screaming and the histrionics are forgotten, that will remain."
Kramer was born in Connecticut in 1935 and grew up in the Washington area. While a student at Yale University in the early 1950s he attempted suicide, an act he attributed to the alienation he felt because of his sexuality.
After graduation he worked for a talent agency in New York, then Columbia Studios, which sent him to London. His biggest film success was Women in Love in 1969, which he adapted from the DH Lawrence novel.
Kramer's activism career was born when he gathered with friends in his New York City apartment in 1981 to discuss a new illness that was ravaging the community. That meeting spawned the Gay Men's Health Crisis advocacy group.
"The very first people who got infected and died were my friends, my age group, from New York and Fire Island," Kramer told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2017. "So, from the very beginning I got involved."
But he fell out with the group a year later after clashing with fellow members and went on to launch the more combative Act Up, whose motto was Silence = Death.
It was a pattern that was not uncommon for a tenacious man who could be a brutal critic. In a recent interview with the Boston Globe, he referred to the National Institutes of Health as "a cesspool of mediocrity" and his friend Dr Fauci as the "consummate manipulative bureaucrat". (He was an equal-opportunity offender, becoming a pariah in the gay community for a satirical 1978 novel, Faggots, that lambasted what he saw as its hedonism).
Kramer's best-known play, The Normal Heart, debuted in 1985 and told the largely autobiographical story of a New York writer's fury as Aids strikes down his lover and friends in the early 1980s while public health and elected officials turn away. A 2011 production on Broadway won three Tony awards.
His most recent work was a sprawling, 1,600-page alternative history of America. It included the line, "Show me a plague and I'll show you the world!" Kramer, at times, seemed exhausted by the burden of his activism.
In a 2017 interview with The New York Times, a frail Kramer lamented that the Aids crisis was still ongoing - as was his fight for equality and social justice. "I don't think that things are better generally," he said. "We have people running this government who hate us, and have said they hate us. The fight's never over." Joshua Chaffin

 Kanye West[1] has been taking control of his narrative, and allegedly that includes spreading rumors about his ex Kim Kardashian West's[2] new boyfriend, Pete Davidson[3]. Here's what West is reportedly saying about the Saturday Night Live star[4].

Kanye West is allegedly spreading rumors that Pete Davidson is gay and had AIDS 

 On Jan. 28, Page Six[5] reported that Kanye West has been spreading some unfounded rumors about Pete Davidson. Sources told the publication that the rapper is telling 'anyone who will listen' that the SNL star[6] is gay and has AIDS. West also allegedly said that Davidson is a 'junkie' and has threatened to have him beaten up. 

The sources' claims align with comments recently made by DJ Akademiks on Twitch[7]. 'Kanye has been telling anyone within an earshot of himself, he's trying to spread a rumor that Pete Davidson has AIDS,' the YouTuber said. 'I'm telling you this is a fact. I've heard this from eight people. He's telling everybody!' 

DJ Akademiks expressed disapproval for the rapper's alleged behavior. 'Bruh, if you gotta spread a rumor that the n—- f—ing your wife got AIDS, you burnt out, bro. Wrap it up. It's over.' 

 Kanye West, The Game - Eazy (Lyrics)[8] 

 Kanye West recently slammed Pete Davidson in new song 'Eazy' 

 The Donda rapper[9] has publicly threatened Davidson with violence before. On Jan. 15, West released a new song titled 'Eazy.' [10]He drops the comedian's name in a line where he says he could 'beat' the comedian's 'ass.' 

West referenced a nearly fatal car accident he survived in 2002 before mentioning Davidson. He raps, 'God saved me from that crash/Just so I can beat Pete Davidson's ass.' 

A woman's voice asks, 'Who?' right after West says Davidson's name, implying that the comedian is unrecognizable and irrelevant. 

The rapper's new song came out while he was under investigation for battery following an incident where he admitted to punching a man who asked for an autograph.

 There is no evidence to suggest that the 'Saturday Night Live' star has AIDS, but he does have Crohn's disease 

 There is no reason to believe that any of Kanye West's claims about Pete Davidson are true. While there isn't any evidence that the comedian has AIDS, he has spoken publicly about his experience with Crohn's disease. 

Davidson opened up about the autoimmune disorder in 2016. 'I got Crohn's disease when I was 17 or 18,' he said (via People[14]). 'My stomach would be in pain all day and I wouldn't be able to eat I'm sick, I have Crohn's so it sucks.' 

After Barstool Sports made fun of the pigmentation around Davidson's eyes by calling them 'butthole eyes,' the comedian's former fiance, Ariana Grande[15], came to his defense by mentioning his disease. 

'Y'all do kno this man has an auto immune disease right?' she tweeted. '.. like you do understand what you're doing when u do this right ? jus wanna make sure.' 

Davidson has also made self-deprecating jokes about health. 'I got engaged and no one could believe it, and I can't believe it, and yeah, I get it,' he joked on an episode of SNL. 'She's the number-one pop star in the world and I'm that guy from SNL that everyone thinks is in desperate need of more blood.'

Standing in Foley Square, Manhattan, on Thursday, July 21, ahead of our first big protest against the treatment of the LGBTQ community around monkeypox, I thought to myself, "We need to keep fighting for change in our healthcare system."
Monkeypox is a brisk and awful virus causing blisters to form around the genital areas, including the face, and even in the eyes. Although this particular disease is spread among men who have sex with men, it is also transmitted through skin-to-skin contact.
Prior to knowing this information, I had traveled to Fire Island, a gathering of the gay community in Long Island at the beginning of June, where my friends and I rented a house for the weekend.
Days later, I heard that several of my friends were developing an illness, which we now know to be monkeypox. After asking friends of friends if they had caught the virus too, we realized that over twenty people in our friendship circles had monkeypox. Of course, that evening, I visited the CDC website for further information. It stated that in New York alone, only 23 people had tested positive for monkeypox in June. Something did not seem to add up—from the very beginning, it felt like this virus was downplayed or underreported.
The LGBTQ community is typically vigilant about our health. Many of us are aware, from the AIDS crisis in the eighties, the lack of consideration towards one's health can take out a population.
To further investigate the matter, I had conducted some individual research and found that the U.S. had tens of thousands of doses of the vaccine approved for use against monkeypox, Jynneous. So, on Friday, June 21, I visited The Department of Health in Chelsea to express that I had been in close contact with my friends who had caught monkeypox, and desperately needed the vaccine. There is only a four day window from the time of exposure where the vaccine can prevent viral transmission.
I was shocked when the nurse informed me that she could not give me the vaccine because 1,000 doses had been available in New York in the first national distribution of the vaccine. After advising me to visit the emergency room, I was met with the same response by doctors. I was completely horrified, not only because I wasn't able to receive a vaccine that appeared to be easily accessible, but because it dawned on me that Pride, the biggest national LGBTQ gathering was occurring a few days after this, on June 26.
With thousands of people in close contact with each other all weekend, I was certain that a health crisis was set to unravel before my very eyes.
Immediately, I called several news outlets and explained that a possible epidemic was about to occur and that it would be detrimental to the LGBTQ community if the people who are in power do not speak about it. I was quickly turned away by two major news outlets, until I called NY1 local news. That evening, they agreed to interview me.
I'd rightly assumed, after Pride, that monkeypox cases would skyrocket to thousands. Yet vaccines were not being distributed. Sadly, many news outlets were still refusing to cover the outbreak in detail, so I took to Facebook to organize a march in Foley Square, in mid-July, demanding more testing, more vaccines, and easier access to the treatment that seemed to be denied.
A sense of excitement began to brew, and spread to other organizations like—ACT UP NY, PrEP4ALL, VOCAL-NY, Housing Works, and Callen-Lorde, along with other queer leaders and activists volunteering to join. In order to cooperate with these organizations, Consequently, we pushed back the protest date to Thursday, July 21, in Foley Square, New York, at 6pm.
Over 200 brave activists took to the streets, demanding more rights for their health. It was an evening filled queer rage, moving performances, inspirational speeches from activists, and most importantly, a strong sense of unity that ignited a fire within us. We focused on the negligence surrounding our healthcare system and the apparent intransigence that was occurring, when it came to making these vaccines available. We telling those in power that be that they can not mess with our health—that they cannot wave the rainbow flag and say that they are our friend if they are not willing to keep us healthy and safe.
The protest gained significant media attention and raised awareness of the fact that over a million doses were ready to be shipped in April, from Denmark, but were held in a freezer at the time as they were not FDA approved at the time. But what makes this more shocking is that the 300,000 doses in Denmark that were FDA approved and ready to be shipped, were still held in that same freezer for weeks, not considering the priority in our healthcare system.
This was naturally confusing for the LGBTQ community, as a flight from Denmark to America is only ten hours long - that one flight could save many lives.
I thought to myself, is there no urgency surrounding this because it predominantly affects gay people?
There is already a narrative out there that monkeypox, which disproportionately affects the LGBTQ community, is something to be ashamed of, as this virus is not discrete; it causes blistering on the face.
Of course, this brings back the same trauma that those before us experienced with AIDS, as many of the symptoms, too, could not be hidden. We went through this in the eighties, when our community pressured the FDA to remove the red tape from treatments for AIDS patients suffering from rare infections—I couldn't believe that almost forty years later, things hadn't quite changed.
I am very sensitive to a system that is resistant. I grew up in a very Orthodox Jewish family in Boston, Massachusetts, and moved to Long Island when I was 11. I started learning "Mishnah" and "Talmud," the first major written collection of the Jewish oral traditions, as early as eight. Naturally, this urged me to be precocious and think about philosophical and theological matters.
Despite being an outcast, I was empowered from a very early age to take on big ideas and question the things around me. As much as I experienced a childhood that was strict and closed, it was also a childhood where questions were not shunned.
This allowed me to form Jewish Queer Youth in 2001—an empowering organization that first began communicating in an email chain, consisting of fifteen queer youth under the ages of 22.
At the time, we did not want to accept that we had to live closeted, shameful lives. We were leaders. We refused the narrative that we were somehow victims—the "poor gays" in the Orthodox Jewish world—we were medical school students and young Ph.D. students, who were at the top of their classes. We were truly amazing.
Since 2001, we've accomplished many things that have been a pinnacle force of change for the Jewish LGBTQ community. In 2012, members of JQY sued an organization called JONAH which was openly offering conversion therapy that had traumatized many of our youth at the time. In 2015, we won. It was one of the first ever cases where queer people sued a conversion therapy charity and managed to shut them down.
In that same year, JQY opened up a program for queer Orthodox and Hasidic students which later expanded to several youth hubs in New York, and in December 2021, we were granted a million-dollar donation to bring this same drop-in center to Chicago, South Florida, Baltimore, and New Jersey.
I formed JQY for all of the youth who are too fabulous to think of their lives as anything less, it is a space for them to meet people like themselves; a space where we, as the older, queer generation, empower them. At JQY, they never have to apologize for being themselves—here, they are celebrated.
Though the healthcare system may still be failing us in some aspects, the LGBTQ community has grown immensely over the past forty years.
We are consciously choosing to abandon the narrative of shame that comes with being queer—whether that be related to monkeypox or one of our own being victimized, we will always take to the streets.
That is why phrases like "It has always been that way" need to change.

"AIDS" is now trending on Twitter after right-wing commentator Dennis Prager essentially asked what if gay men were treated like "pariahs" during the AIDS Crisis the way non-vaccinated people are.
Prager made his comment during a Monday interview with Newsmax. During the interview, Prager said that Democratic President Joe Biden's vaccination mandates were making unvaccinated Americans "the pariahs of America as I have not seen in my lifetime."
"During the AIDS crisis, can you imagine if gay men and intravenous drug users, who were the vast majority of the people with AIDS, had they been pariahs the way the non-vaccinated are? But it would have been inconceivable. And it should have been inconceivable."
In response, Twitter user David Lytle wrote, "A reminder that I'm from Kokomo, Indiana—the town that expelled Ryan White from public schools because he was HIV positive, which he contracted through a blood transfusion. Gay men, drug users, and anyone with HIV/AIDS was a pariah. Dennis Prager needs to@go through some things."
Gay political journalist Michelangelo Signorile wrote, "People with AIDS weren't just pariahs; conservative like William F. Buckley Jr. wanted them tattooed. Everyone Prager looks up in to in conservative punditry thought they all deserved what they got -- God's wrath. That's not an exaggeration."
A Twitter user calling herself shauna wrote, "aids victims were often deprived basic human decency. their families disowned them. society shunned them. their bodies were deemed hazardous waste. they were my friends. i loved them. dennis prager needs to keep the memory of their tortured souls out of his f*cking garbage mouth."
Non-binary author Mx. D.E. Anderson wrote, "Prager is playing dumb when he literally was part of the stigmatization of the queer community during the AIDS crisis. He knows what he's doing and he's deliberately lying."
Republican President Ronald Reagan refused to publicly mention HIV until 1985, about five years after the pandemic started. That year, there had been 12,529 HIV-related deaths of AIDS reported to date, according to amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research.
Throughout the '80s and '90s, various Republicans and Christians had said that HIV was God's plague to punish "promiscuous" homosexuals. These groups stigmatized HIV-positive gay men as a public health hazard. Some Republicans and Christians suggested that gay HIV-positive people should be tattooed or forced into quarantine on an deserted island.
Newsweek contacted Prager for comment.

The 'villification' of gay people in the HIV and AIDS crisis must never happen again, a Manchester councillor has said -as more monkeypox cases are found among gay and bisexual men, although none have been in the north west. Labour councillor Pat Karney urged the town hall to challenge disinformation about the disease, which has seen 71 cases identified across the country so far.
He raised concerns that the narrative about gay people perpetuated during the HIV and AIDS pandemic will be repeated as news of monkeypox emerges. Manchester's health scrutiny committee was told the virus was 'endemic' in parts of Western Central Africa, but is now spreading to other countries.
There have been no cases of monkeypox in the north west to date, but data suggests gay and bisexual have been particularly affected by the spread so far.

Coun Karney said: "The name itself is scary and excites anxiety and attention. Many of us have been through this journey before. It was about monkeys and animals in Africa, gay people, HIV and AIDS. We have to learn the lessons from that period in terms of the linkages made on what is basically a health issue.
 "Gay people were vilified and targeted as carriers of diseases from Africa in the early days. If anyone saw Russell Davies' It's A Sin , even large sections of the medical establishment pulled away from treating gay people in a proper and professional manner. 
"Never again. Let us learn. This council has to be upfront about challenging any of the scaremongering, any of the targeting, any of the vilification of any of our communities.
"It's got to challenge the disinformation. We live in a disinformation age. We can never again repeat what went on in the narrative about HIV and AIDS."
Manchester's director of public health David Regan told the committee that the council has been working with voluntary organisations in the LGBT community.
He said: "We know there are lots of anxieties out there about monkeypox, but just to reassure the public, the general risks to public health are low. We are finding out more and more about the transmission routes and we know that so far gay and bisexual men in particular have been affected, but we've also seen a small number of other cases of community transmission.
"We're looking into all 71 cases nationally, learning more. It's also emerging in other countries. It was endemic in parts of Western Central Africa, but clearly we're seeing a spread in a number of countries.
"The good news for us in Manchester is we've got some well established teams and systems to respond to the emerging situation and also we've got the benefit of an excellent regional infectious diseases unit at North Manchester General and our sexual health services which are now all under Manchester University Hospitals Foundation Trust. So from a clinical point of view, in terms of detecting cases and treatment, we've got some of then best expertise in the country."

Nov 09, 2021( Wonkette: http://wonkette.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 We hesitate to say things like "Dennis Prager has outdone himself," because the man is as ignorant[1] as he is self-assured as he is a mediocre white bigot.[2]  
But this is up there. 
You'll remember that Prager recently announced[3] that his bugchaser lifestyle had paid off and that his unvaccinated gross body was full of COVID. Because Wonkette's thoughts and prayers are so powerful, he appears to have survived the ordeal.  
And now Prager is back to bellyaching, [4]because he's just never in his entire life seen anyone treat ANYBODY like pariahs the way they treat unvaccinated idiots, the way they're shunned by society. Can you imagine, Dennis Prager asked,[5] if they had treated gay men like this during the AIDS crisis? CAN YOU IMAGINE? 
 Dennis Prager: "During the AIDS crisis, can you imagine if gay men and intravenous drug users...had they been pariahs the way the non-vaccinated are? But it would've been inconceivable"pic.twitter.com/GQsOq4X63u — Jason Campbell (@Jason Campbell) 1636410010[6] "Anywhere that you have people who are governed by fear of global warming - the idiotic, irrational, sick fear of extinction of the biosphere - I mean, you understand the nonsense that we live with? "If we survive this as a free country, historians will just ask, 'How did this happen? How did people get governed by irrational fears?' 
"Whether it is of the non-vaccinated, who are the pariahs of America as I have not seen in my lifetime any pariah group like this. 
"During the AIDS crisis, can you imagine if gay men and intravenous drug users, if had they been pariahs the way the non-vaccinated are?" 
Can you IMAGINE? 
And nobody answered Dennis Prager, because an entire generation of gay men was dead and unable to answer, largely because of the exact stigma Dennis Prager, a mediocre white bigot, thinks didn't exist.  
JoeMyGod shares this picture[7] of a Moral Majority mailer from the time: 

The Wrap[8] collects a few examples of what gay men and others with HIV and AIDS had to endure back in the 1980s, starting with how Rush Limbaugh had a segment[9] where he made fun of people dying of it, while playing Dionne Warwick's "I'll Never Love That Way Again." Limbaugh, as Prager might remember, commenced burning in hell[10] for all eternity this past February.  
There was William F. Buckley suggesting "AIDS tattoos"[11] to identify people with the virus. Where? "[I]n the upper forearm, to protect common-needle users, and on the buttocks, to prevent the victimization of other homosexuals."  
Was there a sharp rise in violence against gays at the time? Check.[12]  
Flashback to 1982, and here is Larry Speakes, Ronald Reagan's press secretary, answering a journalist[13] asking if the Reagan administration was doing anything about this mysterious new disease: "It's known as gay plague," the journalist asked. Some people in the room chuckled. "I don't have it, do you?" Speakes snapped back, as the room erupted in laughter. "Do you? You didn't answer my question. How do you know?" 
Reagan wouldn't even say the word "AIDS" until 1985.  
Here's a whole entire video about the Reagan administration's (non)response to the AIDS crisis: 
 [embedded content] www.youtube .com[14] ; 
And how did Americans feel about it? Gallup has some polling data[15] from the time: In 1985, the vast majority of Americans (80%) said it was "probably true" that most people with AIDS were homosexual men. More than a quarter of Americans (28%) reported that they or someone they knew had avoided places where homosexuals might be present as a precaution to avoid contracting AIDS — and this number grew to 44% by 1986. And here Dennis Prager is offended that in 2021, people might be simply trying to avoid Walmarts in pig turd settings where unvaccinated idiots congregate. 
Gallup continued: As the spread of AIDS continued, Gallup found some Americans expressing judgmental views about those who had contracted the disease. In two separate polls in 1987, roughly half of Americans agreed that it was people's own fault if they got AIDS (51%) and that most people with AIDS had only themselves to blame (46%). Between 43% and 44% of Americans in 1987 and 1988 believed that AIDS might be God's punishment for immoral sexual behavior. Still, a solid majority (78%) agreed that people with AIDS should be treated with compassion. But most Americans (60%) also agreed that people with AIDS should be made to carry a card noting they had the virus, and one in three (33%) agreed that employers should be allowed to fire employees who had AIDS. Twenty-one percent of Americans said people with AIDS should be isolated from the rest of society. 
And what about people with AIDS who weren't gay? Back to The Wrap, to remind us of the Ryan White story: Ryan White, an Indiana 14-year-old who was infected due to a blood transfusion and diagnosed with AIDS in 1984. He was forced to sue for the right to attend school, endured ostracization and death threats and his family had to move several times before they found a community that would accept them. He also endured frequent homophobic insults[16]. (He was not himself gay.) When his case became high profile, he was used as an example of "innocent" AIDS victims, AKA people who didn't "deserve" it because they didn't contract it through actions society disapproved of. It was so common that White's mother, Jeane Hale, spoke out against it two years after his death[17]. 
"Ryan always said, 'I'm just like everyone else with AIDS, no matter how I got it.' And he would never have lived as long as he did without the gay community. The people we knew in New York made sure we knew about the latest treatments way before we would have known in Indiana," she told the New York Times. 
We could go on and on and on and on, because these are just some quick examples we found in a few minutes of googling.  
So go fuck yourself, Dennis. And yeah, we're gonna keep treating voluntarily unvaccinated people who are spreading airborne viruses to innocent people like pariahs. Deal with it.

COVID-19 and AIDS crisis: NYC gays see parallels, contrasts

NEW YORK (AP) - LGBT New Yorkers who lived through the AIDS crisis of the 1980s see some bleak parallels in the COVID-19 pandemic now wracking their city. But more so, they stress the differences.
Now, they share the same plight as their fellow citizens while the federal government is pledging trillions of dollars to combat the pandemic. Back then they were frighteningly marginalized in the face of indifference from government leaders and much of the public.
"There was a lot of fear and a lot of anger," said Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York City psychiatrist. "Fear because nobody knew what the cause was, anger because of the lack of concerted response."
Drescher was doing his internship and residency at New York hospitals in the early '80s as doctors struggled to learn the cause of AIDS. Effective treatment didn't emerge until 1995.
"In that time, many died, including many of my professional colleagues, patients and friends," Drescher recalled. "My partner and I would sit down every once in a while and ask, 'Who have we lost?'"
According to the city health department, more than 62,000 people died of AIDS in New York between 1981 and 1995. COVID-19 has killed more than 6,300 in the city in just four weeks
Perry Halkitis, dean of the Rutgers School of Public Health and a specialist in HIV/AIDS prevention, was a student at Columbia University and Hunter College in New York during the '80s. "I was petrified," he recalls.
Halkitis says he and other gay survivors of that epoch carry permanent emotional scars. He finds it traumatic to see some similarities in the COVID-19 outbreak.
"There's the same anxiety and powerlessness and helplessness that was very present in the '80s," he said. "And this virus could kill a person in 10 days, instead of years."
Yet he also notes that HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was far deadlier in its early years than the coronavirus. It was viewed for a time as a terminal disease compared to a projected 1% to 3% overall mortality rate for COVID-19 in the U.S.
Andy Humm, 66, co-host of the weekly TV news hour Gay USA, was among several dozen gay men summoned by activist Larry Kramer to a meeting in August 1981, shortly after the first news reports of a mysterious disease that was killing gays. They heard a doctor "softly and terrifyingly tell us what was going on," Humm said.
Kramer and a few colleagues soon founded Gay Men's Health Crisis, the first nonprofit in New York focused on serving people with AIDS.
"I remember one GHMC meeting - the guys would break down, crying for the friends and the way of life they were losing," Humm said. "It was chilling."
He recalls the first major TV news broadcast showing men wasting away from AIDS.
"People gasped. These were good-looking guys who now looked like the Phantom of the Opera," Humm said. "Two guys in my building tied themselves together and jumped out the window."
Among the co-founders of Gay Men's Health Crisis was Dr. Lawrence Mass, who in May 1981 wrote the first news article about AIDS.
"There was confusion, chaos, a lot of denial," he said. "We didn't even know what we were dealing with. With homophobia so overt, we wondered if it might be some kind of plot."
Now 73, Mass still practices in New York, specializing in addiction medicine. He recalls that some gay men, in the 1980s, continued engaging in promiscuous sex even as risks became more apparent.
AIDS was not an equal-opportunity disease in its early years. Overwhelmingly, its victims were gay men, intravenous drug users, Haitians and hemophiliacs. Gay activists believe that the marginalized status of those victims made it easy for President Ronald Reagan's administration - and to some extent New York City's government - to dismiss the seriousness of the crisis.
"AIDS was seen as God's plague and as our just desserts for a hedonistic lifestyle," says James Esseks, a New Yorker since 1987 who heads the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT & HIV Project. "Most of the nation simply looked the other way."
COVID-19, by contrast, strikes virtually every demographic group, although some LGBT activists say their community may suffer disproportionately because of higher rates of HIV and cancer, and discrimination in some health care settings.
Peter Staley, a long-time AIDS/HIV activist in New York, said the Trump administration's initial response to the coronavirus outbreak enraged him, reminding him of the Reagan administration's indifference early in the AIDS crisis
"Over the next nine months, we're all going to know people who will die," Staley said. "We're going to have, compacted into nine months, what we went through over 15 years in New York City."
"At least we could go to funerals back then, and hug each other through all that pain," he said. "We're not going to have that this time. We can't gather in person to celebrate the lives of those we've lost."
Among the thousands of New Yorkers killed by AIDS were a huge number of highly talented and creative gay men - artists, musicians, designers and others.
COVID-19 deaths are less focused, though the LGBT community has suffered notable losses. They include playwright Terrence McNally, transgender activist Lorena Borjas and lawyer Richard E. Weber, Jr., 57, a longtime board member of the LGBT Bar Association of Greater New York who managed its free legal clinic.
The association's executive director, Eric Lesh, was a grade-schooler in Florida as the AIDS crisis unfolded, He's been in New York nearly 20 years and knows many survivors of that epidemic.
Lesh, 42, who along with his husband weathered a bout of COVID-19, was shocked by Weber's death.
"Richard would have watched lots of his friends pass away in the AIDS crisis," Lesh said. "And then to be swept up in another pandemic -- it just feels so sad."

2022 DEC 08 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- A new study on HIV/AIDS is now available. According to news reporting originating from Victoria, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Gay men living with HIV (GMHIV) are at relatively high risk for suicide." 
 Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University of Victoria: "To inform tailored suicide prevention interventions, we conducted a photovoice study with 22 GMHIV with a history of suicidality. Our study findings revealed three discrete but connected themes characterizing suicidality among GMHIV: first, HIV stigma featured prominently in participants' narratives who described accumulating experiences of prejudice that triggered their hopelessness. Second, many participants perceived their HIV as a personal failure and felt shamed and blamed, heightening men's suicidality. Third, to avoid disgrace, men withdrew from social interactions, resulting in isolation. However, the subsequent dearth of social interaction weighed heavily, as men admitted longing for social, sexual and romantic connections. All themes contributed in complex ways to participants' experiences of suicidality." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "The findings affirm the need for tailored suicide prevention efforts focused on promoting social connectedness and public health efforts to de-stigmatize HIV and mental illness."

2023 AUG 16 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Investigators publish new report on HIV/AIDS. According to news reporting from Baltimore, Maryland, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, "Black gay and bisexual men are overburdened by HIV in the USA. While the socioecological model has been applied to understand potential mechanisms of HIV acquisition among black gay and bisexual men, there is mixed evidence on the impact of internalised stigma on HIV risk among this population." 
 Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Maryland: "This systematic review protocol paper outlines the systematic review being conducted to determine the relationship between internalised racism, internalised homophobia and engagement in sexual behaviour, which puts individuals at risk for HIV infection. Methods and analysis For the review, we will conduct a systematic review of the literature, summarise and critique published scholarly literature on the associations between forms of internalised stigma and sexual behaviours among black gay and bisexual men. We will conduct a systematic search of published qualitative and quantitative research studies published during and after 1993. The searches will be conducted in Ovid Medline, Ovid APA PsycInfo and EBSCO SocINDEX databases. Studies will be included if they were conducted in the USA, with samples that comprised African American/black cisgender gay, bisexual, queer and other men who have sex with men, measured internalised racism and/or internalised homophobia, and assessed sexual behaviour risk for HIV acquisition. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval will be required for this review." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "We will report our findings using the guidelines outlined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Findings of this review may offer new opportunities to study internalised mechanisms impacting outcomes and to identify research gaps and spur additional queries in the group most disproportionately impacted by HIV."

Rapper DaBaby doubled down on his NSFW rant about gays, AIDS and women following a backlash against him from superstars like Dua Lipa.
“I'm gonna address this weak-ass internet shit one time, and then I'm [gonna] get back to giving my love to my fans, 'cause what me and my fans do at the live show, it don't concern you n*****as on the internet or you bitter bitches on the internet,” the 29-year-old rapper shared in a clip posted on his Instagram story.
The comments were noted by Yahoo in a piece published Tuesday. (RELATED: Diddy, DaBaby Will Perform At Shaquille O'Neal's Super Bowl Festival)
 After DaBaby's homophobic rant at Rolling Loud, Dua Lipa fans have asked the singer to remove the rapper from her remix of “Levitating.”https://t.co/HvQW7oBwRJ
 - billboard (@billboard) July 27, 2021
“I said, 'If you don't got AIDS, put a cellphone lighter up,'” he added. “I said, 'If you ain't suck dick in the parking lot, put your cellphone lights up.'” (RELATED: DaBaby Arrested On Battery Charge)
“All the lights went up - gay or straight - you wanna know why?” DaBaby continued. “Because even my gay fans don't got f*cking AIDS, stupid ass n*****. They don't got AIDS. My gay fans, they take care of themselves. They ain't no nasty gay n*****, see what I'm saying? They ain't no junkies on the street.”
But he wasn't done yet, the rapper, born Jonathan Lyndale Kirk, tried to then clarify his comments further and said his gay fans got class and “ain't sucking no dick in no parking lot” and said his gay “fans got standards!”
On Sunday, the rapper told the crowd at the three-day music festival Rolling Loud at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, that if they “didn't show up” that day “with HIV, AIDS, or any of them deadly sexually transmitted diseases,” then put their “cellphone lighter up.”
“Ladies, if your pussy smell like water, put your cellphone lighter up,” he added, the outlet noted. “Fellas, if you ain't sucking dick in the parking lot, put your cellphone lighter up.”
Following the initial backlash, the superstar rapper didn't apologize and basically said the internet “twisted” his words and those who weren't there “weren't supposed to see that shit anyway” and, therefore, shouldn't be saying anything, the Los Angles Times reported.
Singer Dua Lipa slammed his comments and said she was “surprised and horrified” by his anti-gay and sexist rant, TMZ reported.
“I don't really recognize this as the person I worked with,” she added, following the pairs collab on her monster hit, “Levitating.”
The “One Kiss” hitmaker explained she stands “100% with the LGBTQ community.”
Shortly after reports surfaced about the rapper on Tuesday, he took to Twitter and “apologized” and said he had no intentions of “offending anyone.”
 Anybody who done ever been effected by AIDS/HIV y'all got the right to be upset, what I said was insensitive even though I have no intentions on offending anybody. So my apologies
 But the LGBT community... I ain't trippin on y'all, do you. y'all business is y'all business.

2023 JUL 19 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Current study results on HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news reporting out of Ann Arbor, Michigan, by NewsRx editors, research stated, "South Asian gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) in the United States are subsumed under the broad, heterogeneous category of Asian GBMSM in national surveillance systems." 
 Funders for this research include University of Michigan. 
 Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Michigan: "Disaggregated data on their rates of HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing are not publicly reported. This is problematic as the diversity of ancestries, cultures, and customs across subgroups of Asian GBMSM may contribute to differential HIV and STI testing experiences. To address this deficit in knowledge, 115 South Asian GBMSM recruited through social media advertising and peer referral were surveyed about their patterns of HIV and STI testing. In the past 6 months, almost two-thirds ( n = 72, 62.61%) had two or more male sex partners, and more than a quarter ( n = 33, 28.70%) had condomless anal sex with two or more male partners. In the past year, more than one in four ( n = 32, 27.83%) had not been tested for HIV, and more than two in five ( n = 47, 40.87%) had not been tested for STIs. The prevalence of past-year HIV and STI testing was lower among participants aged 35 years and those who had never used pre-exposure prophylaxis." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Participants who were partnered were less likely to have been tested for HIV, and those who were born outside the United States were less likely to have been tested for STIs in the past year. Findings highlight gaps in domestic HIV- and STI-prevention efforts with respect to adequately engaging South Asian GBMSM and suggest that some segments of this subgroup may benefit from targeted outreach."

2023 AUG 30 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Fresh data on HIV/AIDS are presented in a new report. According to news originating from Denver, Colorado, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, "Poetry is an ideal tool to convey participant voices in social research as it compresses the meaning and essence of participant narratives through using evocative sensory words that illuminate nuances of lived experience." 
 Financial supporters for this research include University of Denver Center For Community Engagement. 
 Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Denver: "Expressive poetics is an emerging arts-based research method that facilitates a multi-sensory and relational analytical process. In this article, the authors describe and illustrate an adapted expressive poetics research method through highlighting the experiences of Two Spirit, lesbian, gay, transgender, or queer (2SLGBTQ) Indigenous youth that participated in a culture-centered HIV prevention curriculum." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "It is our hope that through creating dialogic poems, we deepen and nuance the salient experiences of participant youth, acknowledge our relationship through adding our creative response to their calls for care, and create a model for others to engage in a similar process. In a time when 2SLGBTQ bodies are increasingly targeted and policed, it is more important than ever to center and amplify these voices."

Larry Kramer, a prominent gay rights activist whose vociferous writings and actions took on a lagging government response to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, has died. He was 84 years old.
"Rest in power to our fighter Larry Kramer. Your rage helped inspire a movement. We will keep honoring your name and spirit with action," tweeted Act Up -- the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power -- one of several groups he founded as the HIV virus ravaged the gay community in the late 20th century.
Citing Kramer's husband, The New York Times attributed his death to pneumonia. The octogenarian had suffered a number of afflictions in his storied life, including HIV and liver disease, for which he underwent a transplant in 2001.
In 1981 Kramer founded the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the first organization supporting HIV-positive people, leaving a year later following disputes with his fellow organizers.
He went on to found Act Up in 1987, leading protest marches and disruptions of government offices, Wall Street and Catholic leadership to shock US leaders into combatting AIDS.
Born on June 25, 1935 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Kramer graduated from Yale in 1957 before doing a stint in the Army.
He then made a foray into film, working in London on "Dr. Strangelove" and "Lawrence of Arabia."
He was known as a provocative screenwriter, nabbing a 1971 Academy Award nomination for his adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's "Women in Love."
He later turned to themes of homesexuality, publishing in 1978 a lightning rod of a first novel -- "Faggots" -- which through its piercing satire explored promiscuity, drug use and sadomasochism in the gay community.
In the early 1980s Kramer was among the first activists to recognize AIDS as a fatal infection likely to spread and kill globally across lines of gender.
"Our continued existence depends on just how angry you can get.... Unless we fight for our lives we shall die," he wrote in a 1983 essay published in a gay-focused outlet, the New York Native.
Though his harsh rhetoric and often combative style alienated some, he channeled his furor over the government's perceived apathy on AIDS into urgent work that ultimately transformed American health care.
"In American medicine, there are two eras -- before Larry and after Larry," Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease expert now leading the US fight against the coronavirus pandemic, told The New Yorker in 2002.
Fauci, who became one of the nation's most prominent voices on federal AIDS research, developed a friendship with Kramer after the activist grabbed his attention after dubbing the doctor an "incompetent idiot" and killer in 1988.
Kramer's singular voice played a key role in pushing the federal government to improve testing and approval of drug regimes for HIV patients.
"Once you got past the rhetoric," Fauci told the NYT upon learning of the activist's death, "you found that Larry Kramer made a lot of sense, and that he had a heart of gold."
"Larry Kramer's death hits our community hard," tweeted GLAAD, a nonprofit centered on LGBTQ acceptance. 
"He was a fighter who never stood down from what he believed was right, and he contributed so much to the fight against HIV/AIDS."

Larry Kramer, a prominent gay rights activist whose vociferous writings and demonstrations took on a lagging government response to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, has died. He was 84 years old.
At a time when the infection was yet to be named, Kramer spearheaded a crusade to provoke action from the medical and political establishments that  were failing to research, mitigate or even acknowledge the spread of HIV.
"Rest in power to our fighter Larry Kramer. Your rage helped inspire a movement," tweeted Act Up -- the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power -- which was among the groups he founded as the virus ravaged the gay community.
Citing Kramer's husband, The New York Times attributed his death to pneumonia. As well as being HIV-positive, the octogenarian struggled with ill health during his storied life, undergoing a liver transplant in 2001.
In 1981 Kramer founded the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the first organization supporting HIV-positive people, leaving a year later following disputes with fellow organizers.
He founded Act Up in 1987, leading protest marches and disruptions of government offices, Wall Street and Catholic leadership to goad US leaders into combating AIDS.
"He was a fighter who never stood down from what he believed was right," tweeted LGBTQ charity GLAAD. 
- Fight or die -
Born on June 25, 1935 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Kramer graduated from Yale in 1957 before a stint in the Army.
He jumped into film, working as a production executive in London on "Dr. Strangelove" and "Lawrence of Arabia."
He became a provocative screenwriter, nabbing a 1971 Academy Award nomination for his adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's "Women in Love."
"I was in the film industry. I was on my way to making a great deal of money; I was not a gay man first by any manner of means until I became involved in fighting AIDS, and because someone close to me died," he told NPR in 1992. 
"And suddenly I was no longer the white man from Yale, I was a faggot without a name."
He shifted his focus to the theme of homosexuality, publishing in 1978 a lightning rod of a first novel -- "Faggots" -- a piercing satire exploring promiscuity, drug use and sadomasochism in the gay community.
In the early 1980s he was one of the activists who recognized early on that HIV/AIDS was a fatal infection likely to spread and kill globally across gender lines.
"Our continued existence depends on just how angry you can get... Unless we fight for our lives we shall die," he wrote in a 1983 essay published in a gay-focused outlet, the New York Native.
Kramer lashed the era's leaders with blistering criticism, including then president Ronald Reagan and New York mayor Ed Koch.
His play "The Normal Heart" drew critical acclaim for chronicling the rise of the crisis in New York, with a successful 1985 off-Broadway run, later revivals in the early 2000s and a film adaptation.
- 'Ferocious' -
Though his harsh rhetoric and often combative style alienated some, Kramer's passion over the government's apathy on AIDS ultimately transformed American health care.
"In American medicine, there are two eras -- before Larry and after Larry," Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease expert now leading the US fight against the coronavirus pandemic, told The New Yorker in 2002.
Fauci -- more famous now for the federal response to the coronavirus outbreak -- evolved into one of the nation's most prominent voices on AIDS research.
He developed a friendship with Kramer after the activist snatched his attention -- dubbing the doctor an "incompetent idiot" and a killer in 1988.
Kramer's singular voice played a key role in pushing the federal government to improve testing and approval of drug regimes for HIV patients. 
In one of his final interviews, Kramer said he was penning a new play about COVID-19, which he would not live to finish.
"Once you got past the rhetoric," Fauci told the Times on Wednesday, "you found that Larry Kramer made a lot of sense, and that he had a heart of gold."
Tributes deluged social media, with singer Elton John calling him a "giant of a man" while Julia Roberts -- who starred in the movie version of "The Normal Heart" -- declared him "ferocious and tireless in his beliefs."
New York mayor Bill de Blasio also tweeted his praise of the late activist: "He stirred the pot, called out the powerful and, much to the chagrin of some people, he was almost always right."
"We're mourning a great New Yorker today."

One of the main exponents of the Geração 80 movement, Brazilian artist Leonilson (1957-1993) has just won his first major retrospective in Portugal.
The exhibition "Drawn - 1975 1993" brings together more than 250 works in different styles and materials, offering a panorama of the various phases of his career: from the vibrant and colorful works of his early career to the famous introspective embroidery of his final years.
"Leonilson is really a very prominent artist on the Brazilian and Latin American scene, but if you cross the ocean, almost nobody knows who he is. My goal is to change that and present [to the international audience] this incredible body of work," says the curator, Dutchman Krist Gruijthuijsenz.
The show landed at Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art, in Porto, after passing through Berlin and Malmo (Sweden).
To arrive at the final set of works that make up the exhibition, Krist Gruijthuijsenz resorted to pieces from other museums, private collectors and, mainly, the collection of the Leonilson Foundation, maintained by the artist's family.
Leonilson's sister and one of the people responsible for the entity, Ana Lenice, aka Nicinha, traveled to Portugal to accompany the launching. Almost 30 years after her brother's death, she believes that the works are still relevant.
"The part about corruption and politics in Brazil is still the same, only the names have changed. Leonilson's autobiographical part is also current, the questions he raised are still relevant," she says.
Died prematurely at the age of 36 due to AIDS, Leonilson profoundly changed the characteristics of his work after being diagnosed with the disease. 
O artista Leonilson, que deixou uma série de gravações O artista Leonilson, que deixou uma série de gravações                             The artist Leonilson, who left a series of recordings - FOLHA DE S.PAULO 
"The autobiographical element is something extremely intertwined to the way Leonilson's work is constructed. His works are intimately related to his own body and his own biography," says Krist Gruijthuijsenz, curator of the exhibition.
In his evaluation, Leonilson intensely transmitted in his works the experiences of discrimination and prejudice he went through as a homosexual and a man from the Northeast of Brazil. Several of the pieces incorporate criticism of gender stereotypes, behavioral patterns, and the social abyss between rich and poor in Brazil.
This is the case of "Vogue Ideal" (1976): a fanzine that presents an alternative edition of the famous magazine of the same name. In the issue illustrated by Leonilson, full of colors and extravagant visuals, there is criticism of the content normally presented in publications about the fashion world.
Director of the Serralves Museum, Frenchman Philippe Vergne says that the values expressed in the Brazilian's work are particularly relevant in the current world context. "Leonilson is an absolute legend, a reference for generations that followed him. This is an exhibition that also brings values of empathy and humanity. These are values that Leonilson spreads through his work," he said.
Born in Fortaleza, José Leonilson Bezerra Dias moved with his family to São Paulo when he was still a child, in 1961. In the São Paulo capital, he enrolled in art school and began to experiment with artistic practice with various materials, but never finished the course.
Still at the beginning of his career, he began to use only Leonilson as his artistic name. In 1981 he begins an intense period of traveling to Europe, where he met and became close to several artists who also became references for his work, such as Eva Hesse and Blinky Palermo.
The big influence at this time was the Italian transavanguardia: a movement from the late 1970s that stood out for its return to figuration, mythology, and intensive use of color.
"That movement had a very big importance for Leonilson. So he wasn't afraid to be very colorful and very figurative at that time," evaluates the curator.
During a trip to New York in 1986, the artist visited an exhibition of textile works produced by the Shakers - a North American Christian sect focused on handmade production and with vast confection of stylized maps of their territories.
This contact, reinforced by an approximation to the work of Arthur Bispo do Rosário (1909-1989), would intensify Leonilson's self-reflexive textile work.
The diagnosis of AIDS, in 1991, marks a point of transformation in the artist's work. The works gain much more sober contours, with reflections on life and death.
One of the highlights of this period are the seven drawings from the series "The Dangerous" (1992). In the first illustration, Leonilson included a drop of his HIV-positive blood: a public declaration of his personal struggle against the disease.
"It's a very strong work, done after a trip to the hospital. He felt very contaminated, on many levels," explains Krist Gruijthuijsenz.
The exhibition also gives special emphasis to the illustrations made by Leonilson for the journalist Barbara Gancia's column in Folha
, between 1991 and 1993.   
In black and white, the satirical reflections address the political situation in Brazil at the time: a country in social and political upheaval that was witnessing the impeachment of its first president chosen in direct elections after the military dictatorship.
His last year of life is marked by deteriorating health conditions. In this phase, Leonilson could only work with fabric, needle, and thread.
A former student of a Catholic school, he also incorporates elements of Christian iconography, such as crosses and biblical references. These elements are quite explicit in the pieces made for his last exhibition, held in the Morumbi Chapel in São Paulo and reproduced in the European show. The retrospective will be on display in Porto until September 18.
In BrazilIn
São Paulo, Galeria Superfície opened a show dedicated to the artist on April 3, and will remain on display until June 4
. The
curator was Lisette Lagnado, art critic and author of the first retrospective of Leonilson, in 1995
.
20 works, in different materials, seek to highlight Leonilson's affinity with the work of the Greek poet Konstantinos Kavafís (1863-1933).
The parallel between the two was addressed in the last interview granted by the Brazilian.
To mark the 30th anniversary of the artist's death, in May 2023, the Leonilson Foundation will hold a series of small thematic exhibitions, with no starting date yet. Those responsible are also analyzing the promotion of a large commemorative exhibition in the São Paulo capital.

 On Monday, far-right media personality Dennis Prager went on Newsmax to defend people who refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccine. During his comments, he first claimed that COVID antivaxxers are suffering discrimination (they are not), then claimed that gay men were not discriminated against during the height of the AIDS crisis (they definitely were).  

Prager said this: 

'During the AIDS crisis, can you imagine if gay men and intravenous drug usershad they been pariahs the way the non-vaccinated are? But it would've been inconceivable.' 

Watch for yourself:

So yeah, to start, HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is not transmissible through the air or through casual physical contact. It is in fact spread only via the sharing of blood or other bodily fluids. And unlike people who refuse to get the COVID-19 vaccine, people infected with HIV are not an infection risk to other people simply by breathing the same air. Get the facts here[3].  

Second, people refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine are not subject to violence, ridicule, bigotry, hate or otherwise driven out of society. They're simply being encouraged to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease. 

As for gay men and intravenous drug users *not* being turned into pariahs, there are of course plenty of examples to the contrary. For now we'll focus on the way gay men were treated.  

For instance, Rush Limbaugh had a recurring gag on his radio show[4] in the 80s in which he mocked people dying of AIDS filled with unambiguously homophobic overtones. According to the Los Angeles Times, Limbaugh even once said 'Gays deserved their fate.' 

And conservative activist and commentator William F. Buckley once proposed forcibly tattooing all AIDS patients[5]. 

And by 1986, it was clear there had been a sharp rise in violence committed against gay men[6] as the AIDS crisis worsened. 

Prejudice and hostility against gay men stoked by the AIDS epidemic was actually so intense that it was applied to anyone with AIDS. For instance, Ryan White, an Indiana 14 year old who was infected due to a blood transfusion and diagnosed with AIDS in 1984. He was forced to sue for the right to attend school, endured ostracization and death threats and his family had to move several times before they found a community that would accept them. He also endured frequent homophobic insults[7]. (He was not himself gay.) 

When his case became high profile, he was used as an example of 'innocent' AIDS victims, AKA people who didn't 'deserve' it because they didn't contract it through actions society disapproved of. It was so common that White's mother, Jeane Hale, spoke out against it two years after his death[8].  

'Ryan always said, 'I'm just like everyone else with AIDS, no matter how I got it.' And he would never have lived as long as he did without the gay community. The people we knew in New York made sure we knew about the latest treatments way before we would have known in Indiana,' she told the New York Times. 

Here are some other examples of how gay man and AIDS sufferers were treated in the 80s.

As a testament to how different HIV is from coronaviruses like COVID-19, approximately 700,000 Americans have died from AIDS since the disease was first identified in 1981. A horrific tragedy that was only curbed by LGBTQ organizations who were literally fighting for their lives in the face of massive indifference, the switch to more frank and detailed sex education in schools, and the development of life-saving treatments.  

But 755,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the US since 2020.

2023 AUG 24 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily -- Current study results on Immune System Diseases and Conditions - HIV/AIDS have been published. According to news reporting originating in New Orleans, Louisiana, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, "Purpose of reviewGlobal disparities in HIV infection, particularly among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM), indicate the importance of exploring the multi-level processes that shape HIV's spread. We used Complex Systems Theory and the PRISMA guidelines to conduct a systematic review of 63 global reviews to understand how HIV is socially patterned among GBMSM." 
 Financial support for this research came from Partners for Advancing Health Equity grant through the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. 
 The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, "The purpose was to conduct a thematic analysis of the reviews to (1) synthesize the multi-level risk factors of HIV risk, (2) categorize risk across the socioecological model, and (3) develop a conceptual model that visualizes the interrelated factors that shape GBMSMS's HIV 'risk.'Recent FindingsWe included 49 studies of high and moderate quality studies. Results indicated that GBMSM's HIV risk stems from the individual, interpersonal, and structural levels of the socioecological model. We identified a few themes that shape GBMSM's risk of HIV infection related to biomedical prevention methods; sexual and sex-seeking behaviors; behavioral prevention methods; individual-level characteristics and syndemic infections; lived experiences and interpersonal relationships; country-level income; country-level HIV prevalence; and structural stigma. The multi-level factors, in tandem, serve to perpetuate GBMSM's risk of HIV infection globally.The amalgamation of our thematic analyses from our systematic reviews of reviews suggests that the risk of HIV infection operates in an emergent, dynamic, and complex nature across multiple levels of the socioecological model." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "Applying complex systems theory indicates how multilevel factors create a dynamic and reinforcing system of HIV risk among GBMSM." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

'I've lived with HIV for 35 years - and this virus hasn't beaten me'; Ahead of World Aids Day, Gerard McGrath - a gay man living with HIV - reflects on how medicine and attitudes have changed since the 1980s

These days I live a life you might call cosy: I've been married to my husband, Alan, for 13 years, and I've worked for Haringey Council for 20. In the 1980s, though, I really did live it up.
I moved to London in 1983 in search of its famous gay nightlife scene - a far cry from my home in the tiny Irish town of Dundalk, where same-sex relationships were still illegal. Most nights I went out with other guys from the London hotel where I got my first job. We would count up our tips, jump in a cab and head to Heaven nightclub [in Charing Cross]. We'd party the evening away and make it back in time for our 6am shift the next day.
Everything changed for me in 1986, when I was sitting in Westminster Hospital with the parents of my first boyfriend, Brian. At just 26 he had Aids-related dementia, and as he lay there dying he had no clue who we were. All he could talk about was the helicopter that he was convinced was under his bed. "I can hear it, I can hear it," he kept saying. Watching what happened to Brian was when I first felt the fear that would haunt me and my friends for decades.
I was diagnosed with HIV a year after Brian died, when I was 28.
There are more than 100,000 people in the UK living with HIV today, but long-term HIV survivors like me are few in number. When I caught HIV there was no antidote to this horrible virus, and my doctors had little to offer other than counselling. It felt like a death sentence: you knew that more likely than not, your immune system would give way to a horrible cancer or to pneumonia and it would spell your end.
I'm here to tell the tale because I was lucky. While Brian developed Aids after contracting HIV, I developed what was then known as an Aids-related complex (ARC), which damaged my health but not my life expectancy. If it wasn't for a hunch, brought on by a stubborn cold, I might not have been diagnosed with HIV for many more years. One day after work I got on a bus to St Stephen's Hospital on Fulham Road and asked for a test. Two weeks later I got my answer: a doctor told me in a very matter-offact way, "You are HIV positive."
I don't know who passed the virus on to me; whether it was Brian or someone else. I could have had it for years before I was diagnosed in 1987, the doctor said. I was in shock, and the news had barely sunk in before there came a phone call from my uncle in Ireland two days later. He said, "Gerard, your mum died this morning". She had had a massive heart attack and passed away within an hour. I was absolutely devastated. I flew home immediately for her funeral, and didn't even think about the fact I had HIV until I returned to London.
I went back to my job to find a note on my locker, telling me to go and see the food and beverages director. He told me, "We're going to have to let you go on the grounds that it looks bad for publicity." I had confided in just one colleague about my diagnosis before my mother's death - we were friends, I thought, always going out for after-work drinks and having a giggle - and she must have told my boss. Having seen what happened to Brian, I was counting myself lucky that I wasn't seriously ill.
It hadn't occurred to me that having HIV could so completely upend my life in other ways.
The worst part was that my employer wouldn't provide me with a reference for work at another exclusive hotel, and nowhere would give me a look-in without one. I soon ended up on the streets. I slept in Green Park and St James's Park, moving about to try to feel safe. Eventually I took up a friend's spare room in Tottenham, but the minute I had money in my pocket again I turned to drink. I was working in a pub by then, and I'd knock back as many vodka and orange juices as I could before I'd stagger to the nearest off-licence and buy another bottle, waking up in Victoria station half the time instead of my own bed.
When my friend and his ex-boyfriend reconnected, I had to find somewhere new to live. It was then that I contacted the Haringey HIV and Aids unit. They gave me temporary accommodation and later provided me with a flat in Tottenham. It was at that time that I became a peer supporter for men who had just been diagnosed with HIV, and I soon found that there were two ways to live with this virus. There were those who gave in and holed up in bed, too scared even to leave the house for fear of the course their illness might take; we'd call that "death by duvet". Then there were those of us who refused to sit still and wait to die. Despite all I'd been through, I was determined to be in the latter camp.
On New Year's Eve 1986, just after Brian had died, I was in the queue for Heaven, and a young man came up to me, shook my hand and said, "I'm dying and this is my last night out; I want to make it a good one." That was the reality of being a gay man then; people seemed to be dropping like flies.
In 1992 I was asked to join the board of trustees at the London Lighthouse, then the world's biggest residential HIV centre. Lighthouse was visited by Princess Diana many times - there's a photo of us together - and each time we spoke, she made me feel like she genuinely cared and wanted to be there.
I made a resolution from early in the 1990s to be open about my HIV status, to show that there is no reason to be ashamed. I have a network of friends who accept me, and an understanding employer. My family too were supportive. They found out that I had HIV from a TV interview that I gave. My father told me before he died that all he wanted was for me to be happy, that he wasn't ashamed of me for my sexuality or for my HIV status, and my sister told me how proud she was of me for speaking out.
Others were not so lucky. The stigma of having the "gay disease" broke up families. At St Stephen's Hospital, where I became outpatient services manager, I saw friends dying whose parents wouldn't let their partners be there for their final moments. Everyone who lived through that has survivor's guilt. We'd always be thinking, why was it them and not us? Or, when is it going to be me?
As you might imagine, dating was one of the hardest parts of having HIV as a young man. My life changed when I met my husband Alan on a gay chat site. We talked for years before we went on our first date in 2010. We got married in 2014, as soon as it became legal.
Alan doesn't have HIV, but his family was initially less accepting than mine. By the time I'd met them, though, they had come around to accept his sexuality. I was nervous to tell them about my HIV status, but all they wanted to know was that I was in good health. Today
Alan and I live together in a one-bed flat in Wood Green with our cat, Fluffy. Alan is a DJ and I follow him around the world to go to his gigs, which is not something I'd pictured myself doing when I was told I had HIV all those years ago.
The world has changed enormously since 1987, and medical progress has been nothing short of miraculous. People who think they've been exposed to HIV can take pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can stop an infection from taking hold. Then there are antiretroviral drugs, a combination of which can stop the virus from replicating in your body. I took these drugs in 2013, when my CD4 count, the number of white blood cells in my bloodstream, had begun to drop. In just three weeks my count was back to normal and any side-effects had subsided. Now I take just one tablet a day, Biktarvy, which keeps my symptoms at www.bay.No one who contracts HIV today needs to go through what I did - there is no more "death by duvet". The law protects people like me from discrimination: the 2010 Equality Act stops employees from being sacked because of their HIV status, from the moment they are diagnosed. I will always live with this virus, but I have a happy life filled with love and success. In 2023 I can truly say that I control my health and not the other way around. As told to Lauren ShirreffWorld Aids Day is on Friday.

Province apologizes after gay couple used in post on HIV/AIDS awareness

Advocates say a social media post by the Saskatchewan government that was pulled within hours perpetuates a long-held - and damaging - perception about HIV and AIDS.
The picture, which was shared across social media platforms on Tuesday to mark World AIDS Day, showed two men beneath the heading: "HIV is on the rise in Saskatchewan."
By Wednesday morning, the image had been removed and the province had issued an apology.
Health Minister Paul Merriman apologized to "everyone in the community" for the "disappointing" post and said a deputy minister would look into how it came to be published.
"I don't think it portrays everyone who is fighting HIV/AIDS," Merriman said.
Critics went a step further, arguing the image furthers a myth that HIV/AIDS only affects members of the gay community.
"In all honesty, the government's post only services to further stigmatize the gay and queer community at a time when HIV is preventable and treatable," said OUTSaskatoon interim executive co-director Jack Saddleback.
"HIV is different nowadays. It's not the 1980s. We are 2020, and HIV does not discriminate based on your romantic and sexual orientation."
Opposition Leader Ryan Meili called the message homophobic.
Saskatoon Sexual Health executive director Heather Hale said the image doesn't represent the reality of HIV in Saskatchewan.
"For a time, HIV was seen as an infection that was spread, passed on or afflicted upon the queer community. And we know in Saskatchewan that HIV looks different than that, and that the face of HIV reflects our community," Hale said.
The province's HIV rate is twice the national average.
A decade of government data shows intravenous drug use is by far the leading cause of new infections.
The second is sex between heterosexual partners.
"I think it's telling that was their only message," said Jason Mercredi, executive director of Prairie Harm Reduction - an organization known until earlier this year as AIDS Saskatoon.
"It goes to show HIV hasn't been given the attention it needs."
Mercredi said the gaffe has created an opportunity to have a frank conversation about what Saskatchewan people should know about HIV. "At least now people are talking about it," he said, encouraging people to learn about the role sharing drug equipment plays in spreading HIV.
Hale said good health messaging should be rooted in an idea of "nothing about us, without us."
"Health promotion is complicated. It's a hard job," she said.
"But at SSH, we really try to show the complexity of the situation while also leaving the viewer feeling they have the power to make choices."
Merriman said the government continues to fund measures to prevent the spread of HIV.
Preliminary data show 118 new cases were identified in 2020 as of Sept. 24. - With Leader-Post files from Arthur White-Crummey zvescera@postmedia.com twitter.com/zakvescera !@COPYRIGHT=© 2020 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved.
